## Film development in Japan is getting worse and more expensive

## What I bought

|                  |                                     |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Developer        | Kodak D-76 1 Gallon (3.8 liters)    |
| Fixer            | Ilford Rapid Fixer                  |
| Wetting Agent    | Ilfotol                             |
| Development Tank | Jian Cheng Compact Development Tank |
| Dark room        | Dark Bag from some Chinese brand    |
| Storage          | 5 litre brown bottle                |
| Misc             | Some measuring cups for the kitchen |

The reasons for the chemicals were simply it was available. One mistake I realized after the purchase was that the shelf life for the developer is 2 month in a half full bottle. I got 5 litre bottle to store it so I need to use the developer a lot in that 2 month. I definitely will get a smaller bottle and go with a litre developer powders the next time. I blame the guy at the store because I asked him which one to get and told him that it's my first time developing, yet he gave me this option.

For the tank, I see a lot of Youtubers are using patterson tanks, but they weren't readily available in Japan. I came across this Chinese brand and the reviews were good, and it seemed to have the same out-to-in mechanism when loading the film, instead of the in-to-out of the steel reels. As a first-timer, that was the biggest concern, putting film onto the reels in the dark. After I got the thing, I tried with the negatives already developed, and it was fairly easy to load them even in the bag

## What I'm developing

I'm doing a Lomography Lady Grey 400 which I went around several different stores across Tokyo but all of them said it's gonna take 2 weeks, which I'm ok to wait but still annoys me a little.

## Setting things up

### Developer

I will have to make the powder into 3.8 litre water first.

I will put 375ml of the solution aside as is written at the bottom of the tank

### Fixer

For the Rapid Fixer by Ilford, I will prepare in 1:4 ratio, so 75ml of the solution, and 300ml of water.

### Wetting agent

Ilfotol has 1 : 200 dilution, and since the tank needs 375ml, I would need 1.87ml of the solution diluted up to 375ml. For this, I don't have enough equipment to measure so I will do 2 grams of the solution. In the future, I want to get a pipet to measure 2ml precisely.

## Developing

### Loading up

This was the part I was most scared about, but it was easier than I thought. I put the tank, film, film opener and scissors into the dark bag, then I turned the light off (just in case) and loaded the film by just feeling it. One thing I'm glad that I did was that I practiced loading before with already developed film from before. Although it was cut into a smaller strip, it was still useful to practice the feel for the slot to put the beginning of the film in.

### Pre-rinse

After sealing the tank, I rinsed the film with water because a Youtuber said to do so.

### Develop

Development time for [Lomography Lady Grey 400 with Kodak D-76 at 20 degrees celsius is 7.5 minutes](https://www.lomography.com/magazine/94343-lady-grey-and-earl-grey-development-times).

1. Pour the developer into the tank
2. Give agitation for 10 seconds
3. Every 30 seconds, give agitation for 5 seconds and smack down from 2.5cm height to get rid of the bubbles
4. Pour out the developer
5. Give a lot of water into the tank. This is in place for the stop bath
6. Pour in the fixer
7. Do the agitation and smack every minute for 2â€“5 minutes. I will do 4 just to be on the safe side not to degrade the film
8. Pour them out into a beaker.
9. Give another good rinse with water to get rid of the chemicals
10. Pour in the wetting agent
11. After about 30 seconds of swishing around, pull them out
