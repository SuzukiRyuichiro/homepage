Given the recent increase in the popularity of Formula 1, there are plenty of non-Japanese speakers visiting the Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka. This year, I went for the first time, but it was quite hard to know exactly how to get to the circuit and where to get the ticket from online resources. It was confusing even to me, a fluent Japanese speaker, so it must be more confusing for people visiting from abroad. In this blog, I will try my best to list all possible way to get to the circuit from Nagoya, which is one of the closest major cities where many other fans and media personnel stay. Many people choose Nagoya since any hotels closer to the circuit are fully booked even before the tickets goes on sale 🤯 Also, I will list some other possible solutions which I might want to try in the coming years if I ever visit again.

# Trip from Nagoya to the circuit.

Trains are the cheapest way to get to the circuit, yet hardest to figure out. There are different types of trains available, and different train companies depending on which stations you want to get off from.

## The most popular route: Nagoya (名古屋) → Shiroko (白子) 🚃 + Shuttle bus 🚌

This route is by far the most popular route. Shiroko station is a station that is about 5km away from the circuit. During the Grand Prix weekend, there are extra express trains and limited express trains that goes directly to and from Nagoya station, and many people use this train. From Shiroko station, there is a special shuttle bus that goes to the circuit, which most of the people also use. However, ticketing system is quite hard to figure out for a first time visitor.

### Figuring out the train companies and ticketing system

First, you have to distinguish the train company you are using. In Nagoya station, there are multiple train companies that uses the same building, but different turnstiles. There are JR (Japan Rail), Kintetsu, and the subway. To get to Shiroko station, you have to use Kintetsu, which has its own designated turnstile. If you get to the Nagoya station, you have to look for signs that direct you to the Kintetsu turnstile, not JR!!

Then, you have to understand the different types of trains, local, express, and limited express. For local and express trains, you **DO NOT** need to buy extra limited express ticket. You can simply buy a ticket to Shiroko station, which is ¥1000, and hop on to the train that comes first. You can buy the ticket at the vending machine at Kintetsu Nagoya Station. However, on the day of the race, it can get quite crowded by the people who are trying to get the ticket, so it would be better to have the contactless payment with you, such as Suica and Pasmo. If you have a Suica or Pasmo card, you can simply charge that up and tap in and out of the station. Express train takes about 50 minutes from Nagoya to Shiroko station.

Express trains are relatively cheap but fast enough. Also, there's less stress of missing one because there's no reserving seats for a specific train. You can simply wait at the platform and if you're lucky, you can get a seat for the whole ride. However, obviously there are more people standing than sitting. You have to keep that in mind.

Local trains are the same but since it stops at every station on the way, it is much slower. Therefore, if you don't wanna spend extra money but want to get to the destination reasonably fast, express trains are the one to use.

Then there's the limited express trains. For this, on top of the normal fee, which is ¥1000, you have to pay ¥920 as a limited express fee. Limited express trains have designated seating system, which means you will be guaranteed a seat. Also, it is just a little bit faster than the express, and takes about 40 minutes to get to Shiroko station.

There are two ways to get the limited express ticket. First is to go to the station and use the ticketing office or vending machine. However, during the weekend, the limited express trains can fill up during the peak hours, so you shouldn't expect that you would get a seat for the train departing in a few minutes. Possibly, you would have to choose the train that depart in 20 or even 40 minutes after.

To avoid that wait, and to make sure you get the train you want, you can use the Kintetsu website to purchase one. On the website, you can sign up, then simply search for available seats from the web app and pay via credit card. After the purchase, you go to the station, go through the turnstile with Suica or the ticket to the Shiroko station (which you have to purchase on top of the mobile limited express ticket), and just go to your designated seat. You don't really need to show the mobile ticket when getting on or off. Conductors do come around but they don't really check if you have the limited express ticket or not.

This must be the most confusing part for the first time visitors. I saw many people who got on to the limited express without knowing that they need an extra ticket. Those people end up standing in front of the toilet since there are no seats available, and then get charged the extra fee by the conductor that goes around. So make sure that you know which train you want and whether you need an extra ticket or not!

### Lining up for the shuttle bus

Once you get to Shiroko station, you will see a long line of people waiting for the shuttle bus. Shuttle bus to the circuit cost ¥450, and you can pay by Suica or Pasmo cards, or by cash. Payment done after you get off at the circuit. It is better to have those contactless cards since it is much faster.

The most annoying thing about the shuttle bus is the wait time. On Friday morning, which I went quite early, the wait was about 5 minutes. Looking at some tweets by fans, later hours on Friday is also not super crowded and the wait time is about 30 mins. However, on Saturday and Sunday, obviously there are more people who are going to the circuit so the line can get quite long. The line goes around the area in front of the station multiple times, and takes you about more than 1 hour to get onto a bus!! There's an option to use a taxi as well, but keep in mind that the line for taxis is also quite long. Some people choose to walk the 5km since it can be faster sometime.

## Next most popular route: Nagoya (名古屋) → Suzuka Circuit Inno (鈴鹿サーキット稲生駅) 🚃 + Walk 🚶

There's another station which is closer to the circuit called Suzuka Circuit Inno station.

## The return trip

To get back to Nagoya after the sessions are over, the nightmare begins 😭

## Other considerations
