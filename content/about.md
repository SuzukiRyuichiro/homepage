## Long version

#### Where am I from?

I was born in Tokyo, Japan and grew up there until the age of 10. Then, my family moved to London and I spent three years, where I acquired my English accent. After that, we relocated to Ljubljana, Slovenia, where I lived for two more years. After 5 years of living outside of Japan, I returned to Japan to attend high school in Ehime, a prefecture in western Japan. For college, I studied at Akita International University, a liberal arts college located in northern Japan. During my sophomore to junior year, I participated in an exchange program and studied at George Washington University in Washington D.C., USA. Later, I returned to Tokyo, but thenn later lived in Spain for a year, then returned to Tokyo, and that's where I am.

In short, I don't know where to call home 🤷
