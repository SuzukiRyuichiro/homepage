## Long version

#### Where am I from?
I was born in Tokyo Japan, and grew up there until 10. In 2010, my family moved to London, and I spent three years living in Wimbledon. That's where I got my English accent. After that three years, we moved to Ljubuljana, Slovenia, where I spent two years. I came back to Japan in 2015 to study in a highschool in Ehime; a prefecture in western Japan. For college, I studied in Akita International University, which is a liberal arts college in Northern Japan. In 2019 summer, I did a year of exchange program to and studied in George Washington University in DC, USA. During COVID, I came back to Tokyo, and been in greater Tokyo area since. I'm currently in Barcelona Spain, working as a freelance software engineer :)
