### [Section L](https://section-l.co/)
##### August 2021 - April 2022
##### Full stack software developer
Section L is a hospitality company based in Tokyo. The company runs several hotels and a pop-up store in central Tokyo. We developed an in-house application that enables guests and hotel employees to manage check-in, request amenities, send requests to receptionists, and many other aspects of the hotel operation easily and smoothly.

I joined in the very early stage of the application development and participated in developing three different projects.
- Check-in app that handles the check-in process at every property of Section L.
- Admin app, where hotel employees can manage guests across the properties and answer requests and questions.
- InterSection, which is an app that enables inter-guests communication and interactions. A unique point about Section L is that the guests are encouraged to interact with each other through multiple events. We built an app that serves as a platform for those events to be organized. Also, guests can use the app to communicate with reception.
- And the API that serves the backend of all three applications.
