Le Wagon is an industry leading coding bootcamp founded in France and now has more than 35 campuses across the world.

Since then, I have helped more than 150 students to learn how to build web applications and work on projects as a team.

After a year of assisting the main teachers, I had opportunities to stand in front of the class to give lectures as a main teacher as well.

I have been working as a teacher / teaching assistant at Tokyo campus for over a year. Recently, after relocating to Spain, I taught the web development course of the Madrid campus, as well as the Cape Town campus in South Africa.

### [Section L](https://section-l.co/)

##### August 2021 - April 2022

##### Full stack software engineer {{< mdi alias="vuejs" >}} {{< mdi alias="language-javascript" >}} {{< mdi alias="language-ruby" >}} {{< mdi alias="language-ruby-on-rails" >}}

Section L is a hospitality company based in Tokyo. The company runs several hotels and a pop-up store in central Tokyo. We developed an in-house application that enables guests and hotel employees to manage check-in, request amenities, send requests to receptionists, and many other aspects of the hotel operation easily and smoothly.

I joined in the very early stage of the application development and participated in developing three different projects.

- Check-in app that handles the check-in process at every property of Section L.
- Admin app, where hotel employees can manage guests across the properties and answer requests and questions.
- InterSection, which is an app that enables inter-guests communication and interactions. A unique point about Section L is that the guests are encouraged to interact with each other through multiple events. We built an app that serves as a platform for those events to be organized. Also, guests can use the app to communicate with reception.
- And the API that serves the backend of all three applications.

### [Evolany](https://evolany.com/)

##### August 2021 - April 2022

##### Full stack software engineer intern {{< mdi alias="react" >}} {{< mdi alias="language-javascript" >}} {{< mdi alias="language-php" >}}

Evolany is a company that provides no-code platform called Anybot, which enables companies who wants to automate their message bot to make customer support more efficient. Although I joined as an intern, I worked as like any other full-time engineers. From minor debugging to introducing new features, I've worked on multiple projects during the time I was at the company. Also, since I joined a few month before where the engineering team grew rapidly, I helped to re-write the setup documentations for the new comers to be more descriptive. On top of that, I helped many new full time developers to get familiar with our in house framework and guide their way through the on boarding process.
