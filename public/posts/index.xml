            <title>First Time Developing Black and White Film</title>

            <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;film-development-in-japan-is-getting-worse-and-more-expensive&#34;&gt;Film development in Japan is getting worse and more expensive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been developing film with mostly Kitamura, one of the biggest photo printing chain in Japan. Many stores in Tokyo have in-store developer and scanner and they would develop, scan and give you a QR code from which you can download the results. I used to like the quality and how easy it is to use. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that recently, they increased the price for a higher quality scan, and they made the cheaper scanning option&amp;rsquo;s quality so low. Also, the scans had too much contrast most of the times. On top of that, they usually can do C41 in 2~4 hours but when you ask for B&amp;amp;W, they tell you that they have to send it to a factory and develop it there, hence the time it takes bumps up to 2+ weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Given those circumstances, I decided to dip my toe into the rabbit hole of developing at home. It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve wanted to do for a while anyways, and it brings down the cost of developing.</p>

<p>The reasons for the chemicals were simply it was available. One mistake I realized after the purchase was that the shelf life for the developer is 2 month in a half full bottle. I got 5 litre bottle to store it so I need to use the developer a lot in that 2 month. I definitely will get a smaller bottle and go with a litre developer powders the next time. I blame the guy at the store because I asked him which one to get and told him that it&rsquo;s my first time developing, yet he gave me this option.</p>
<p>For the tank, I see a lot of Youtubers are using patterson tanks, but they weren&rsquo;t readily available in Japan. I came across this Chinese brand and the reviews were good, and it seemed to have the same out-to-in mechanism when loading the film, instead of the in-to-out of the old-school steel reels. As a first-timer, that was the biggest concern, putting film onto the reels in the dark. After I got the thing, I tried with the negatives already developed, and it was fairly easy to load them even in the bag. I highly recommend this if you cannot find a patterson tank.</p>
<h2 id="what-im-developing">What I&rsquo;m developing</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing a Lomography Lady Grey 400 which I went around several different stores across Tokyo but all of them said it&rsquo;s gonna take 2 weeks.</p>
<h2 id="setting-things-up">Setting things up</h2>
<h3 id="developer">Developer</h3>
<p>I will have to make the powder into 3.8 litre water first.</p>
<p>I will put 375ml of the solution aside as is written at the bottom of the tank</p>
<h3 id="fixer">Fixer</h3>
<p>For the Rapid Fixer by Ilford, I will prepare in 1:4 ratio, so 75ml of the solution, and 300ml of water.</p>
<h3 id="wetting-agent">Wetting agent</h3>
<p>Ilfotol has 1 : 200 dilution, and since the tank needs 375ml, I would need 1.87ml of the solution diluted up to 375ml. For this, I don&rsquo;t have enough equipment to measure so I will do 2 grams of the solution. In the future, I want to get a pipet to measure 2ml precisely.</p>

<h3 id="loading-up">Loading up</h3>
<p>This was the part I was most scared about, but it was easier than I thought. I put the tank, film, film opener and scissors into the dark bag, then I turned the light off (just in case) and loaded the film by just feeling it. One thing I&rsquo;m glad that I did was that I practiced loading before with already developed film from before. Although it was cut into a smaller strip, it was still useful to practice the feel for the slot to put the beginning of the film in.</p>

<p>After the process is done, I hung the roll in a closet. I got the film hanging clips because they were cheap but I guess it is not a necessity. I didn&rsquo;t ge the squeegee but I think it dried out fine.</p>

<h3 id="scanning">Scanning</h3>
<p>After the film was dried, I scanned my film using my Olympus OME EM5 Mk-2 and Lomography&rsquo;s scanning thingy. It is still a struggle to get a good quality for scan. I went stingy on macro option so I just have an attachment which makes my zoom lens into a &ldquo;macro&rdquo; lens.</p>
<p>Another difficulty is the build quality of the scanning board from Lomography. For the price they charge, the thing is bit too flimsy and also the AA battery doesn&rsquo;t light the backlight enough. I use my mobile battery to directly power the back light.</p>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>After scanning, I don&rsquo;t wanna pay for Adobe so I used Snapseed to turn the negatives into positives. Here, it is another struggle to get the edit right. I am always never satisfied with the result but I guess that&rsquo;s another process to enjoy. Previously, it was hating on Kitamura&rsquo;s edit but now I have only myself to blame 😝</p>

<h2 id="end">End</h2>
<p>The whole process was easier than I thought. I don&rsquo;t know what I was afraid of. Now I&rsquo;m waiting for C41 chemicals to come as well. I know it will be slightly more effort since you need to keep the temperature high and need more chemicals but shall be fine.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Given the recent increase in the popularity of Formula 1, there are plenty of non-Japanese speakers visiting the Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka. This year, I went for the first time, but it was hard to figure out how to get to the circuit, and where to get the ticket from online resources. It was confusing even to me, a fluent Japanese speaker, so it must be more confusing for people visiting from abroad. In this blog, I will try my best to list all possible way to get to the circuit from Nagoya, which is one of the closest major cities where many other fans and media personnel stay. Many people choose Nagoya since any hotels closer to the circuit are fully booked even before the tickets goes on sale 🤯 Also, I will list some other possible solutions which I might want to try in the coming years if I ever visit again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Given the recent increase in the popularity of Formula 1, there are plenty of non-Japanese speakers visiting the Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka. This year, I went for the first time, but it was hard to figure out how to get to the circuit, and where to get the ticket from online resources. It was confusing even to me, a fluent Japanese speaker, so it must be more confusing for people visiting from abroad. In this blog, I will try my best to list all possible way to get to the circuit from Nagoya, which is one of the closest major cities where many other fans and media personnel stay. Many people choose Nagoya since any hotels closer to the circuit are fully booked even before the tickets goes on sale 🤯 Also, I will list some other possible solutions which I might want to try in the coming years if I ever visit again.</p>
<h1 id="trip-from-nagoya-to-the-circuit">Trip from Nagoya to the circuit.</h1>
<p>Trains are the cheapest way to get to the circuit, yet hardest to figure out. There are different types of trains available, and different train companies depending on which stations you want to get off from.</p>
<h2 id="the-most-popular-route-nagoya--shiroko---shuttle-bus-">The most popular route: Nagoya → Shiroko 🚃 + Shuttle bus 🚌</h2>
<p>This route is by far the most popular route. Shiroko station is a station that is about 5km away from the circuit. During the Grand Prix weekend, there are extra express trains and limited express trains that goes directly to and from Nagoya station, and many people use this train. From Shiroko station, there is a special shuttle bus that goes to the circuit, which most of the people also use. However, ticketing system is quite hard to figure out for a first time visitor.</p>
<h3 id="figuring-out-the-train-companies-and-ticketing-system">Figuring out the train companies and ticketing system</h3>
<p>First, you have to distinguish the train company you are using. In Nagoya station, there are multiple train companies that uses the same building, and you have to know which turnstile is for which company. There are JR (Japan Rail), Kintetsu, Meitetsu and the subway. To get to Shiroko station, you have to use <strong>Kintetsu</strong>, which has its own designated turnstile. If you get to the Nagoya station, you have to look for signs that direct you to the Kintetsu turnstile, not the others!!</p>
<p>Then, you have to understand the different types (speed) of trains: local, express, and limited express. For local and express trains, you <strong>DO NOT</strong> need to buy extra limited express ticket. You can simply buy a ticket to Shiroko station, which is ¥1000, and hop on to the train that comes first. You can buy the ticket at the vending machine at Kintetsu Nagoya Station. However, on the day of the race, it can get quite crowded by the people who are trying to get the ticket, so it would be better to have the contactless payment with you, such as Suica and Pasmo. If you have a Suica or Pasmo card, you can simply charge that up and tap in and out of the station. Express train takes about 50 minutes from Nagoya to Shiroko station.</p>
<p>Express trains are relatively cheap but fast enough. Also, there&rsquo;s less stress of missing one because there&rsquo;s no reserving seats for a specific train. You can simply wait at the platform and if you&rsquo;re lucky, you can get a seat for the whole ride. However, obviously there are more people standing than sitting. You have to keep that in mind.</p>
<figure><img src="/posts/how-to-get-to-suzuka-from-nagoya/express.jpg"><figcaption>
      <h4>Express train on the Sunday morning, around 9AM</h4>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Local trains are the same but since it stops at every station on the way, it is much slower. Therefore, if you don&rsquo;t wanna spend extra money but want to get to the destination reasonably fast, express trains are the one to use.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the limited express trains. For this, on top of the normal fee, which is ¥1000, you have to pay ¥920 as a limited express fee. Limited express trains have designated seating system, which means you will be guaranteed a seat. Also, it is just a little bit faster than the express, and takes about 40 minutes to get to Shiroko station.</p>
<p>There are two ways to get the limited express ticket. First is to go to the station and use the ticketing office or vending machine. However, during the weekend, the limited express trains can fill up during the peak hours, so you shouldn&rsquo;t expect that you would get a seat for the train departing in a few minutes. Possibly, you would have to choose the train that depart in 20 or even 40 minutes after.</p>
<p>To avoid that wait, and to make sure you get the train you want, you can use the Kintetsu website to purchase one. On the website, you can sign up, then simply search for available seats from the web app and pay via credit card. After the purchase, you go to the station, go through the turnstile with Suica or the ticket to the Shiroko station (which you have to purchase on top of the mobile limited express ticket), and just go to your designated seat. You don&rsquo;t really need to show the mobile ticket when getting on or off. Conductors do come around but they don&rsquo;t really check if you have the limited express ticket or not.</p>
<p>This must be the most confusing part for the first time visitors. I saw many people who got on to the limited express without knowing that they need an extra ticket. Those people end up standing in front of the toilet since there are no seats available, and then get charged the extra fee by the conductor that goes around. So make sure that you know which train you want and whether you need an extra ticket or not!</p>
<h3 id="lining-up-for-the-shuttle-bus">Lining up for the shuttle bus</h3>
<p>Once you get to Shiroko station, you will see a long line of people waiting for the shuttle bus. Shuttle bus to the circuit cost ¥450, and you can pay by Suica or Pasmo cards, or by cash. Payment done after you get off at the circuit. It is better to have those contactless cards since it is much faster.</p>
<figure><img src="/posts/how-to-get-to-suzuka-from-nagoya/buses.jpg"><figcaption>
      <h4>There are so many buses in use but it doesn&#39;t come fast enough for the people using it...</h4>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The most annoying thing about the shuttle bus is the wait time. On Friday morning, which I went quite early, the wait was about 5 minutes. Looking at some tweets by fans, later hours on Friday is also not super crowded and the wait time is about 30 mins. However, on Saturday and Sunday, obviously there are more people who are going to the circuit so the line can get quite long. The line goes around the area in front of the station multiple times, and takes you about more than 1 hour to get onto a bus!! There&rsquo;s an option to use a taxi as well, but keep in mind that the line for taxis is also quite long. Some people choose to walk the 5km since it can be faster sometime.</p>

<h2 id="next-most-popular-route-nagoya--suzuka-circuit-inoh---walk-">Next most popular route: Nagoya → Suzuka Circuit Inoh 🚃 + Walk 🚶</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s another station which is closer to the circuit called Suzuka Circuit Inoh station.</p>
<h2 id="the-return-trip">The return trip</h2>
<p>To get back to Nagoya after the sessions are over, the nightmare begins 😭 You can simply reverse the route you came with, but make sure to understand the pros and cons of each options</p>
<h3 id="most-popular-route-shuttle-bus---shiroko--nagoya-">Most popular route Shuttle bus 🚌 + Shiroko → Nagoya 🚃</h3>
<p>This is the reverse of <a href="#the-most-popular-route-nagoya--shiroko---shuttle-bus-">the most popular route from Nagoya station</a>. However, you have to keep in mind that the waiting line for the bus is worse than the one in the morning. Since people try to go home all at once, you have to wait for possibly two hours at the parking lot of the circuit waiting for the bus to come. On Friday, I chose this route after seeing Seb speak on the stage, which was around 5PM. In the end, it took me about 2 hours to get onto a bus in the pouring rain 😭</p>

    <img src="/posts/how-to-get-to-suzuka-from-nagoya/friday-bus-waiting.jpg"  class="center "  />


<p>From this experience, on Saturday and Sunday, I chose not to stay until everything was over. On Saturday, I left my seat around around 2 minutes before Q3 was over and headed to the grand stand exit. Then from the exit, saw Max taking the pole and Oscar taking P3, then decided to leave before everyone crossed the line. Leaving the session early gave me a head start and I managed to get onto a bus after waiting for 10 minutes or so.</p>
<p>Also on Sunday, I left my seat when there was about 5 laps left, and saw the end of the race on my phone. I wouldn&rsquo;t have done it if it was as exciting as the Singapore GP, but since Max was miles ahead and none of the drivers I passionately support had a good race, I didn&rsquo;t really care to see the end. This was also a good call since I only waited about 5 minutes. However, by the time I got on to the bus, the line grew 3 fold, and probably would&rsquo;ve taken me 30 minutes more if I left a few laps later.</p>

    <img src="/posts/how-to-get-to-suzuka-from-nagoya/sunday-after-race-bus.jpg"  class="center "  />


<p>Once you get to Shiroko station, then the system is the same. If you don&rsquo;t need a guaranteed seat and slightly faster train, then you simply buy a ticket to Nagoya, or tap in with your Suica, then get onto any express train that comes first. I lined up early on Sunday so I managed to sit down for the whole journey back to Nagoya.</p>
<p>If you want to buy the limited express back to Nagoya, then the web app is the way to go. It is easier to get the limited express train back to Nagoya since every one aren&rsquo;t sure if they make it back to the station by the time the train they reserved leaves. What I did on Friday and Saturday is that while riding on the bus, simply estimate the time you arrive at the station, then get the limited express ticket that departs right after the bus arrives at the station. This is the best way because by the time you got to the station, the next earliest limited express are usually sold out by the people who arrived with the few buses before you.</p>
<p>Despite the long line for the bus, this route ensures that you get home since Mie Kotsu, who runs the buses, and Kintetsu are kind enough to set extra trains and buses until everyone is served. Although the bus technically has a time limit set on every day, they usually run beyond that time since they can&rsquo;t serve every one by that deadline. Also, Kintetsu run special express trains to serve more people when high in demand. This cannot be said for the JR, who refuses to run extra trains and people can end up stranded after the final train left.</p>

&lt;p&gt;ワーホリで一年間バルセロナに住んでいるのですが、僕の中で一番の大きな転換点はエレベーターのあるピソに引っ越して、自転車をゲットしたことです。メトロやバスで十分足りる街ではありますが、自転車が自分のバルセロナ生活を何倍も楽しいものにしてくれたと思います。バルセロナに引っ越した当初は、エレベーターなしの 4 階のピソだったため、必然的にメトロに頼り切っていましたが、ずっと地下に居るだけで、特に移動を楽しいと思うことはありませんでした。ですが、自転車を手に入れてから、行動範囲や自由度が格段と上がったのは言うまでもなく、太陽の光を浴びながら移動できることが何よりも嬉しく、通勤や友人の家に遊びに行くのが楽しく思えるようになったのを鮮明に記憶しています。毎朝、仕事場に向かうために Diagonal を駆け抜けるだけでも、この街に来てよかったと思わせてくれました。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;そんな Diagonal のど真ん中で自転車を盗まれました。
自分は街のカフェなどでいつも仕事をしていたのですが、その日はお気に入りのフォカッチャのチェーン店、Buenas Migas の行ったことの無い店舗に行ってみようと、前々から目につけていた Diagonal 沿いにある大きな店舗に向かいました。自転車は Diagonal 沿いの歩道にあるバイクラックに、4 桁の暗証番号式の太いチェーンロックをフレームと車輪を通して地球ロックをしたのを覚えています。平日でしたが、いい天気で人通りも多かったです。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buenas Migas の店舗は広く、WiFi も速いので、仕事をするために長居するには最適の場所です。お昼過ぎから 5 時間くらい作業をしていました。作業が終わり外に出て、バイクラックに近寄ると、自分の自転車が見当たらず、「やられた」と思いました。停めていた所に行くと、チェーンロックだけが暗証番号のところで切られて落ちていました。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;少しパニックになり、友人達に電話をしてどうするか助言をもらい、取り敢えず、近くの警察署に行くことにしました。そしたら見事お休みでした。平日にやってない警察署って何なんでしょう。スペインのお役所に再度失望しつつ、サドルの下に Anker のタグをガムテープで着けていたことを思い出しました。iPad で場所を確認すると、Diagonal の一番端の Westfield の近くで止まって居ることを確認できました。急いで Bicing を使って現場近くまで行きました。実際にタグが反応している所であたりを探しまわっても、自分の自転車は見つからず、遠隔で音を鳴らそうとしても繋がらず、音が鳴ることはありませんでした。純正品では無いの上、iPhone ユーザーではないので、U1 チップを使った方向をピンポイントで探し当てる事もできず、もしかしたらこの辺りでタグの存在に気づいてゴミ箱に捨てたか、通り沿いの建物の中に入ったのかと思い、諦めて帰りました。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;学んだ事&#34;&gt;学んだ事&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;air-tag-は純正品に限る&#34;&gt;Air Tag は純正品に限る&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android ユーザーですが、Air Tag ネットワークにはあやかりたいなと思い購入した Anker のタグですが、部屋の中で鍵を探すだったり、空港で荷物が着いてるか等を確認するくらいにはなりますが、実際の Air Tag 程の効果はありませんでした。やはり自転車だったり、実際になにかピンポイントで場所を特定する必要がある際には、Air Tag + iPhone が無いと難しいんだなと学びました。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;警察は盗難は相手してくれない&#34;&gt;警察は盗難は相手してくれない&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anker のタグが反応している所に行った際に、偶然近くに警察官が居たので、事情を説明して、もし犯人と自転車を見つけた時に捕まえられるように助けてくれないかと Find My の画面を見せながらお願いしましたが、112 に電話をしてくれの一点張りでなんにもしてくれませんでした。向こうとしても自転車や携帯の窃盗なんて日常茶飯事過ぎて、操作する気も無いんでしょうね。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;チェーンロックは暗証番号式は弱点がある&#34;&gt;チェーンロックは暗証番号式は弱点がある&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所有してたロックの中で一番太めのものを使っていたつもりだったのですが、結合部が細くなっていて弱点であることは盲点でした。暗証番号の部分はプラスチックでもあるので、大きめのチェーンカッターがあればある程度容易に切れたのでしょう。自分は持ち歩くものが増えるのが嫌なので、鍵のバイクロックはあまり好きでは無いのですが、スペインの様な盗難がよくある国に住む場合には我慢して鍵のチェーンロックにする事も考えたほうが良いかもしれません。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;バルセロナでは二重ロックも辞さない方がいい&#34;&gt;バルセロナでは二重ロックも辞さない方がいい&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;皮肉なことに、その数日前に持ち運びしやすい折りたたみ式のロックを購入していたのですが、面倒くさくてまだホルダーをフレームに設置していませんでした。その日家を出る際に、どちらのロックを持っていくか、両方カバンに入れて持っていくか、迷った挙げ句いつも通りのチェーンロックを選びました。あのとき、2 つ持って行っていれば、両方ロックを掛けて置けば、悔やまれます…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    alt=&#34;Martin Garrix concert&#34; &gt;



&lt;p&gt;スペインに住んでいて、最初の 4 ヶ月程は特に危ない目に合うこともなかったのですが、ワーホリ期間の最後に近づくにつれて、立て続けに危ない目にあったので、PSA として何が起きたのか、どの様な反省点があるのかを振り返って見たいと思います。いくつかインシデントがあったので、とりあえず 1 つ目&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;マラガでスマホを強奪された&#34;&gt;マラガでスマホを強奪された&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;週末を使って、マラガまで EDM コンサートを観に行きました。コンサート開場は、マラガの市内から電車で 40 分ほど離れたリゾートタウンで執り行われていたので、チケットを買った時点で、一人旅のお財布に優しい値段の宿泊施設は全て埋まっていました。コンサートも朝 2 時までの予定だったので、本当は会場近くに泊まりたかったですが、始発が 6 時にはあるというので、朝帰りで良いかと思い、マラガ市内のホステルを予約しました。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;予定通り、2 時にコンサートが終わり、ゆっくり駅まで海岸沿いを歩きながら適当に時間を潰してから、4 時ころに駅前に着きました。そこに行くまでの途中で、喧嘩がヒートアップして、ある男性が女性をビーチに降りるスロープから突き落とす瞬間を目撃し、少し雰囲気は戦々恐々としていました。とりあえず、駅の入口が開くまで何もやることは無いので、通り沿いにあるベンチにポツリと座って携帯で YouTube を観ていました。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;そうしていたら、突然、横から歩いてきた男が僕の手から携帯をもぎ取り、目の前の裏路地に逃げていきました。一瞬何が起きたか処理が追いつきませんでしたが、携帯を強奪された事を理解し、本能的に追いかけました。&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/getting-robbed-in-mexico&#34;&gt;以前のブログ&lt;/a&gt;に書いたように、その 2 ヶ月前に、メキシコシティで携帯を盗まれたばかりなので、その際に持っていた携帯は、買って間もない新品同様のデバイスでした。その事が頭をよぎり、絶対に取り返してやるという思いで追いかけました。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;犯人がトロかったのが幸い？して、数週間前に自転車事故で左足を捻挫している身ながら、50m 程ですぐに追いつきました。彼の腕を掴んで、英語しか出てこなかったので、&amp;ldquo;You fucking give that back to me&amp;quot;と言ったら、彼が振りかぶって僕の顔にサイドフックを一発。そこまで強いパンチではなかったので、痛さはさほどありませんでしたが、小学生の頃、父親に叩かれて以来、本気の暴力を受けたのは初めてだったので、かなり驚きました。驚いてる暇も無く、二発目のフックが顔に着弾。そして、僕が少しよろけたところを、彼が僕の首に腕を回し、チョークホールドを受けました。苦しいと思っていたら、気を失い、地面に倒れ込みました。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;彼は僕が気を失ったのを見計らって、僕を開放し更に逃走。地面に倒れ込んだ僕は、気を失っていたものの、失ったのはほんの 1,2 秒の話。すぐに意識を取り戻し、一瞬、夢でも観ていたんだっけ？という気分になりましたが、携帯を盗まれていたことをすぐに思い出し、立ち上がって彼の逃げていった方に走り出しました。朝の 4 時の田舎町の裏路地なんで、人っ子一人いませんが、遠目にカップルがいたので、走りながら声をかけるも無視。がむしゃらに犯人を見失わないように追いかけ続けました。そうすると、彼がある分かれ道を右に曲がると、その先は行き止まり。そこで再度追い詰め、今度も彼を掴み、本当に警察には言わないから携帯だけ返してくれと懇願。行き止まりで再度捕まったことからなのか、彼も少し「またやったろか」みたいな構えを見せたものの、まだ盗人の日が浅く、やり切る強さがないのかは知りませんが、手渡しで携帯を返してくれました。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;携帯は失わずに済みましたが、チョークホールドを食らったことから、首の痛みが一週間ほど残りました。更に痛手だったのが、サイドフックを食らった際に、つけていた完全ワイヤレスのイヤホンを両方落としたようで、ホテルに帰るまでそれに気づかず、徹夜をした＋強盗に遭った直後だったので、取りに戻る気力もなく、€150 程したお気に入りの品ではありましたが、諦めました。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;反省点&#34;&gt;反省点&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;兎に角、気を抜かないこと。夜の夜道なんて特に。Youtube を肘を膝にかけて、前かがみで観てたりしたら、格好の獲物だと思われても仕方なかったかもしれません。後、メキシコで盗まれた際にも思いましたが、携帯の首掛けは結構重要かもしれません。個人的には自転車に乗る際のナビとしてつけたりする際に邪魔なので、つけていませんが、なにか着脱が簡単にできるような品があったら、買っておくべきでした。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;後、旅行保険はやはり必須ですね。もちろん、携帯を盗まれると、保険金でカバーしてくれる異常に面倒くさいことにはなりますが、完全に携帯が無くなってしまうだけよりかはマシなのかと。私は今回は盗まれませんでしたが、スペイン滞在時の保険の重要さを身にしみて感じました。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;バルセロナに戻っても盗難未遂があった&#34;&gt;バルセロナに戻っても、盗難未遂があった&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;そんな事件の後、バルセロナに戻ってきてから、友人と夜ご飯を食べた後の帰りに、また盗まれかけました。今度は最寄りの地下鉄の駅構内で、エスカレターであがっていく際に、反対側のお兄ちゃん集団に手を伸ばして来て携帯を取ろうとしてきました。私は、マラガの一件から、スマホを握るときは握力を強めにしていたので、取られずにただ触られた形ですが、こんな家の近くでも盗まれかけるなんて、驚きました。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;さらなる反省点&#34;&gt;さらなる反省点&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;取られずに済んだとき、怒りが込み上げてきて、彼らに向かって強めに F ワードを言った後に中指を立てたら、少し怒らせてしまったらしく、やったろかみたいな感じを出してきました。結局は向こうも威嚇してただけで、特にエスカレーターを登ってきてなにかされるみたいなことにはなりませんでしたが、反撃して痛い目をみるよりかは、大人しく穏便に済ませたほうが身のためだったかもしれません。後、夜中はやはり気をつけるべきですね。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>メキシコ初日からスられた</title>
            <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/getting-robbed-in-mexico/</link>
            <pubDate>Sun, 23 Apr 2023 05:14:21 -0600</pubDate>
            
            <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/getting-robbed-in-mexico/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;メキシコに旅行に来た初日から携帯をスられました。今後のためにも、もっとうまく立ち回れたと思えることを綴って、次につなげようと思います。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/getting-robbed-in-mexico/me.jpg&#34;
    alt=&#34;スられた直後&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;スられた直後&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;どうやってスラれたか&#34;&gt;どうやってスラれたか&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;メキシコシティ初日は、アステカスタジアムでのサッカーの試合の観戦に行く予定でした。慣れていない公共交通機関に手こずり、結局ギリギリの時間帯にタクシーで会場につきました。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;会場入口は、かなりひどい渋滞が起きていました。数少ないゲートに何百もの人が押し寄せて、キックオフまで時間がなくなってくると、後ろの人も焦り始めて、かなり酷いすし詰め状態になっていました。自分も、後ろからの圧迫と、前に進めない状況から、かなり身の危険を感じました。もう少しうまくオーガナイズしてほしい。そんなギュウギュウ詰めの中、時より、人混みの中を逆走してくる、もしくは意味のわからない縦断を無理やりしてくる人達がいました。最初は「チケットを持ってなかったのかな？」とか、「ゲートが違ったのかな？」と思っていましたが、今考えるとあの人達なんでしょうね。近くに居たアメリカ人たちと軽く会話をしてる中で、「そういえば荷物とか気をつけなよ」と、気軽に声をかけられたときには、もう遅かったです。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;警察も特に何もしないというかできない&#34;&gt;警察も特に何もしない。というかできない&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;すぐに近くにいる警察官には言いましたが、僕も、find my device は後述するようにできないし、Fitbit からの呼び出しは遠いのか電源が切れてるのかつながらないし、どこに行ったのかなんて人の多さでは絶対に無理ですね。警察も一応適当にそこら辺に居た人のかばんを探ったりはしてくれましたけど、そんな近場に犯人がいるわけが無く、数分後には、「どんまい」という顔をして去っていきました。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;心構えの反省点&#34;&gt;心構えの反省点&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;調子に乗っていた&#34;&gt;調子に乗っていた&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;渡航する前に、メキシコシティの犯罪の多さを世界のランキングなどで見ていました。ですが、メキシコシティがつい一ヶ月ほど前まで居たケープタウンと同列くらいと言うことで、かなり高をくくっていました。実際、ケープタウンでは&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/south-africa-trip/#%E6%B2%BB%E5%AE%89-&#34;&gt;同僚二人がガッツリ窃盗に遭うのを横で見ていましたが&lt;/a&gt;、自分は安全に事なきを得たので、余裕こいてました。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;浮かれていた&#34;&gt;浮かれていた&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;初めての国に来たということと、ここ数ヶ月やってきたスペイン語が通じること、など、午前中の時点で少し浮かれているフシがありました。スポーツイベント自体は大好きだし、完全に身の回りのことを忘れていました。こういった油断は禁物ですね。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;焦っていた&#34;&gt;焦っていた&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;これもう何回もやってるので、本当に今回で最後にしたいんですが、スポーツイベントにギリギリで行き過ぎること。初めての街なのに、どうやって行くかをマップで調べて、15 分前くらいに着けばいいかと悠長に夕飯を食べていたことを反省しています。その前の週に行ったバレンシア CF の試合も、エントランスで並んでいて、結局キックオフギリギリになってしまいました。今後スポーツイベントに行く際は、これでもかというくらい余裕を持って、入口が空いている時間に行くようにします。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;身なり的な反省点&#34;&gt;身なり的な反省点&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;荷物の持ち方&#34;&gt;荷物の持ち方&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;肩に斜めにかけるバッグを持っていました。なんとなく携帯と財布とパスポートとチケットを入れて。でも、そんな人が触れているのを感じることのできない身なりはやめるべきでした。それか、上着を上から羽織っておくべきでした。後、かばんのジップに開けやすいように紐がついているんですけど、旅行の間だけでも取っておけばよかったですね…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;携帯を無くしたことによって気づいた弱点&#34;&gt;携帯を無くしたことによって気づいた弱点&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;多くのことを携帯に頼っているので、携帯を無くしたことによって、かなり面倒くさい作業が発生しました。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;まず、最初に勿論やろうとしたのは、find my device を使うこと。きっと泥棒も速攻で電源を切るなりするでしょうが、とりあえず場所を見たい。自分の携帯は勿論ないので、友人の携帯を使って、ブラウザからログインを試みる。でも、自分の Google のパスワード、知らない… 全部 1password に頼り切ってるので、ログインできず。そしてその 1password も、パスワードは覚えているけど、Secret Key 暗記しているわけがない。結局、1password のログインはできず、find my device は使えないままでした。セキュリティが高いのは結構ですが、こういった緊急事態に身動きが取れないのは困りますね。 何がベストなんだ &lt;span  class=&#34;inline-svg mdi insentence&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; xmlns:xlink=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&#34; version=&#34;1.1&#34; id=&#34;mdi-onepassword&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34;&gt;&lt;path fill=&#34;currentColor&#34; d=&#34;M12,1C5.92,1 1,5.92 1,12C1,18.08 5.92,23 12,23C18.08,23 23,18.08 23,12C23,5.92 18.08,1 12,1M12,20A8,8 0 0,1 4,12A8,8 0 0,1 12,4A8,8 0 0,1 20,12A8,8 0 0,1 12,20M13,13.5C13,14.13 13.4,14.7 14,14.91V18H10V11.91C10.78,11.64 11.19,10.8 10.93,10C10.78,9.58 10.44,9.24 10,9.09V6H14V12.09C13.4,12.3 13,12.87 13,13.5Z&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;

<h2 id="どうやってスラれたか">どうやってスラれたか</h2>
<p>メキシコシティ初日は、アステカスタジアムでのサッカーの試合の観戦に行く予定でした。慣れていない公共交通機関に手こずり、結局ギリギリの時間帯にタクシーで会場につきました。</p>
<p>会場入口は、かなりひどい渋滞が起きていました。数少ないゲートに何百もの人が押し寄せて、キックオフまで時間がなくなってくると、後ろの人も焦り始めて、かなり酷いすし詰め状態になっていました。自分も、後ろからの圧迫と、前に進めない状況から、かなり身の危険を感じました。もう少しうまくオーガナイズしてほしい。そんなギュウギュウ詰めの中、時より、人混みの中を逆走してくる、もしくは意味のわからない縦断を無理やりしてくる人達がいました。最初は「チケットを持ってなかったのかな？」とか、「ゲートが違ったのかな？」と思っていましたが、今考えるとあの人達なんでしょうね。近くに居たアメリカ人たちと軽く会話をしてる中で、「そういえば荷物とか気をつけなよ」と、気軽に声をかけられたときには、もう遅かったです。</p>
<h2 id="警察も特に何もしないというかできない">警察も特に何もしない。というかできない</h2>
<p>すぐに近くにいる警察官には言いましたが、僕も、find my device は後述するようにできないし、Fitbit からの呼び出しは遠いのか電源が切れてるのかつながらないし、どこに行ったのかなんて人の多さでは絶対に無理ですね。警察も一応適当にそこら辺に居た人のかばんを探ったりはしてくれましたけど、そんな近場に犯人がいるわけが無く、数分後には、「どんまい」という顔をして去っていきました。</p>
<h2 id="心構えの反省点">心構えの反省点</h2>
<h3 id="調子に乗っていた">調子に乗っていた</h3>
<p>渡航する前に、メキシコシティの犯罪の多さを世界のランキングなどで見ていました。ですが、メキシコシティがつい一ヶ月ほど前まで居たケープタウンと同列くらいと言うことで、かなり高をくくっていました。実際、ケープタウンでは<a href="/posts/south-africa-trip/#%E6%B2%BB%E5%AE%89-">同僚二人がガッツリ窃盗に遭うのを横で見ていましたが</a>、自分は安全に事なきを得たので、余裕こいてました。</p>
<h3 id="浮かれていた">浮かれていた</h3>
<p>初めての国に来たということと、ここ数ヶ月やってきたスペイン語が通じること、など、午前中の時点で少し浮かれているフシがありました。スポーツイベント自体は大好きだし、完全に身の回りのことを忘れていました。こういった油断は禁物ですね。</p>
<h3 id="焦っていた">焦っていた</h3>
<p>これもう何回もやってるので、本当に今回で最後にしたいんですが、スポーツイベントにギリギリで行き過ぎること。初めての街なのに、どうやって行くかをマップで調べて、15 分前くらいに着けばいいかと悠長に夕飯を食べていたことを反省しています。その前の週に行ったバレンシア CF の試合も、エントランスで並んでいて、結局キックオフギリギリになってしまいました。今後スポーツイベントに行く際は、これでもかというくらい余裕を持って、入口が空いている時間に行くようにします。</p>
<h2 id="身なり的な反省点">身なり的な反省点</h2>
<h3 id="荷物の持ち方">荷物の持ち方</h3>
<p>肩に斜めにかけるバッグを持っていました。なんとなく携帯と財布とパスポートとチケットを入れて。でも、そんな人が触れているのを感じることのできない身なりはやめるべきでした。それか、上着を上から羽織っておくべきでした。後、かばんのジップに開けやすいように紐がついているんですけど、旅行の間だけでも取っておけばよかったですね…</p>

</span>
</p>
<h3 id="2fa">2FA</h3>
<p>二段階認証を多くのアプリで有効にしていますが、銀行系が少し面倒くさいですね。なぜかわからないですが、りそなと N26 は、自前のアプリの通知で２段階認証を取りたがるんですよ。なので、携帯がなくなった今、N26 を使うのも、りそなで送金するのも、Web アプリを使っても、二段階認証の時点で詰みます。Wise とかは、1password 等のオーセンティケータをつかえるので、デバイスに頼らずとも認証できますが。なぜ、りそなや N26 がそういったことをしないのか、不思議です。</p>
<p>N26 は一応サポートとチャットでやりとりして、一時的に友人の携帯端末と番号を認証のために使えるように変えてもらえました。でも問題はりそな。サポートチャットは絶対につながらない。他の対応はフリーダイアル。メインバンク変えようかな…</p>

<p>もしこれを読んでいて、海外旅行、特にメキシコに行く方は、本当に気をつけてください。</p>

            <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coding boot camp I teach at, one of the students was using a Pinterest&amp;rsquo;s widget for their final project. However, they had an issue where the widget wouldn&amp;rsquo;t show up on their page if the page was reached through clicking on a link within the app. However, it would show up if they reloaded the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-cause&#34;&gt;The cause&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cause is kind of obvious but turbo. If you follow the instruction on Pinterest&amp;rsquo;s installation guide, you would put an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag to the place you want to mount your widget, and put an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag at the end of the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<h2 id="the-cause">The cause</h2>
<p>Cause is kind of obvious but turbo. If you follow the instruction on Pinterest&rsquo;s installation guide, you would put an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag to the place you want to mount your widget, and put an <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag at the end of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">html</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">body</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">...</span>&gt;

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">html</span>&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>What the script does is as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a script tag within the head</li>
<li>Set the source of that script tag to be the main javascript file that is responsible for creating the widget.</li>
<li>That script would run, and mount the widget onto the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag</li>
</ol>
<p>However, because of turbo, that steps are not followed. When the user reach to the page with the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag that should create the main <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in the head, that script won&rsquo;t be run because there is not <code>turbo-reload=&quot;false&quot;</code> attribute.</p>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ことの発端&#34;&gt;ことの発端&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;時々働いているコーディングブートキャンプのケープタウン校が、直近で先生を探していると Slack に流れてきたので、どうせ無職みたいなもんだし、やってみようと手を上げました。本当にすぐに先生がほしいらしく、2 週間後に始まるクラスの最初の 3 週間のコマを受諾しました。フライトは会社持ち、宿泊はマネージャーの実家というなんとも自転車操業っぷり満載ですが、お金をもらって南アフリカに行けるなら何でも良いや、という軽い気持ちで行くことにしました。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;追記: 3 週間先生をやって、一回バルセロナに帰ったものの、また先生が必要だということで、更に 3 週間後くらいにケープタウンに戻ることになりました。この文章をダラダラ書いている途中でまたケープタウンに来たので、その時の経験もまとめて書きました。ケープタウンに合計 1 ヶ月ちょいくらいは居たことになりますね。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;旅の準備というかブラックフライデーで買ったカバンの自慢&#34;&gt;旅の準備。というかブラックフライデーで買ったカバンの自慢。&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;以前、マドリードに仕事に行くときに、もっと大きくて利便性の高いリュックが欲しい！とずっと思っていました。探しているうちに、&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUJ1WvD7nmg&#34;&gt;Tropicfeel の Shell&lt;/a&gt; というかばんが良さそうと目をつけ、ブラックフライデーのセールもあり、衝動買いしました。結局、マドリードの仕事までには間に合わず、今回がこのかばんとの旅行デビューになります。1 月は、南アフリカではもちろん夏なので、持っていく服自体は少なめでした。ただ、一緒に買った服のコンプレッサー兼ミニクローゼットを使ったり、カバンの下に隠れている靴収納袋など、めちゃくちゃ旅行に便利なカバンだなと、とても感心しました。買ってよかった。-&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://nation.tropicfeel.com/s/ryuichiro.s&#34;&gt;リファーラルリンク&lt;/a&gt;。このカバンひとつで 1 週間分の服と、サンダル、ラップトップもろもろを持っていけるので、とても便利です。最近、新バージョンが出たらしく、それもほしい&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;到着そして衝撃&#34;&gt;到着。そして衝撃&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;カタールを経由して、ほぼ一日かけてケープタウンに到着。マネージャーが車で迎えに来てくれました。最初に驚いたのは、彼が裸足だということ。速攻で、「南アフリカの人はみんな裸足なのか？」とググりました。結果、子供のときは結構みんな裸足生活らしく、稀に大人になっても裸足の人がいるらしいです。確かに、たまに裸足の子供を何人か見かける機会がありました。私も、つられたのか、最終的に裸足でちょっと外を歩くのに抵抗がなくなりました。意外と開放的。&lt;/p&gt;

    alt=&#34;ryan bare foot&#34; &gt;



&lt;p&gt;他にも、とりあえずスケールにびっくりしました。バルセロナも一つの街に海と山があると謳っていますが、ケープタウンはそれを 20 倍にしたスケール感でした。テーブル・マウンテンはとてつもなく大きしい、ビーチも終りが見えないし、波も大きしい、行く先々で景色の綺麗さに驚かされました。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;良かったところ&#34;&gt;良かったところ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ほとんど仕事ばっかしてましたが、そんな話してもしょうがないので、ケープタウンの良かったところを書いていきます。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;サーフィン-surfer&#34;&gt;サーフィン &amp;#x1f3c4;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;サーフィンデビューしました。水泳をやっていたので、ベタベタするし泳ぎにくい海はあんまり好きではありませんでした。でも、ケープタウンのビーチは桁違いでキレイだし、でかい。真夏ということもあったので、初日からマネージャーに勧められてサーフレッスンを取ることにしました。行ったところは、一番サーフィンしやすいビーチだという Muizenberg。&lt;a href=&#34;https://surfemporium.co.za/&#34;&gt;Surf Emporium&lt;/a&gt;というビーチの目の前のお店でレッスンを予約しました。その日は偶然空いてましたが、その後レッスンを取ろうとしたら、当日はいっぱいだったりと、メジャーなところらしいので、事前予約をおすすめします。レッスン自体は 1 on 1 で、ウェットスーツとボードレンタルを含めて、90 分で R480(大体 3500 円くらい)。最初はもちろん難しかったですが、徐々にコツを掴んで、何回か立ち上がることもでき、波に乗ってる気分を味わえました。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;その後も、サーフィンしたい欲が出てきて、5,6 回はサーフィンに行きました。もっと小さい頃から触れておきたかったですね。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surf Emporium のレッスンも悪くなかったですが、その後紹介してもらった Bennett というお兄さんが個人でやってる &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.softsurfschool.com/&#34;&gt;Soft Surf School&lt;/a&gt; というスクールで、二回レッスンを受けました。友達と一緒に行けば、Surf Emporium よりもお得にグループレッスンが受けられますし、何より教え方がとても上手でした。レッスンの日の波が良かったのもありますが、上達をすぐに感じられるようなレッスンでした。レッスンをしながら Go Pro で動画を撮影してくれて、後で動画を送ってくれるというサービスがいいところもおすすめです。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;クラフトジン-&#34;&gt;クラフトジン 🥃&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;今まで、ジンを飲んでこなかったのですが、ケープタウンはクラフトジンが盛んらしく、勧められて飲んでいるうちに好きになりました。町中にいくつか蒸留所があり、行く機会はありませんでしたが、見学やテイスティングをしているところもあるそうです。スーパーなんかに行くと、トニックだけで何種類も置いてあったり、ジンに対する熱が伝わってきました。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>個人的に楽しかったのは、Water Front という地区にある Gin Emporium というお店と、CBD (Central Business District) にある The Gin Bar が良かったです。前者は、テーブルマウンテンを眺めながら、ときには港に住んでいるアザラシを見ながら、ジンを楽しむことができます。後者は名の通りジンをたくさん用意しているバーで、数え切れないほどの国内外のジンを揃えています。内装もおしゃれで、良かったです。</p>

<h3 id="churchhaven-flamingo">Churchhaven &#x1f9a9;</h3>
<p>お金持ちのマネージャーの実家が、ケープタウンから北に車で 1 時間半のところにある Churchhaven という村に別荘を持っているということで、週末に連れて行ってもらいました。West Coast National Park の中に位置する漁村で、半島によって潟になっているところに位置しています。筆舌に尽くしがたい程、静かで綺麗なところでした。水や電気は通っていないので、雨水や海の水を貯めたものを使用し、電気も太陽光発電で充電したバッテリーから引っ張ってくるような生活が当たり前だそうです。夜は庭でバーベキューをして、きれいな星空を眺めながらワインを飲んだりしました。この場所は所謂 Gated community のようなところなので、物件を所持していない場合の出入りがどれほど簡単なのかはわかりかねますが、聞いたところによると、Airbnb も何軒かあるらしいです。あと、村から離れたところにボートハウスも貸し出しをしているそうです。ゆっくりとした週末を過ごしたい場合は、とてもおすすめです。</p>

<p>これは来る前から食べたかったもので、ビーフジャーキーのようなんですが、それよりも更に美味しいお肉料理です。南アフリカ出身のコメディアン、Trevor Noah が、どこかで見た動画で、ビーフジャーキーとは比べ物にならないくらいうまいと言っていたので、それ以降、ずっと食べたいと思っていました。南アフリカではガソリンスタンド、スーパー、レストランなど、どこにでも売っていて、簡単に手に入れることがで来ます。お肉も、ビーフが一番見かけますが、ダチョウ、オリックス、シカなど、いろんな種類のお肉でも楽しめます。個人的に一番良かったのはオリックス(Gemsbok)です。カッラカラに乾いたやつと、少し湿気が残っているやつと、味付けが違ったりと、色々と試してみるといいと思います。あと、一緒によく売ってあるのが Droëwors というサラミのような肉料理です。これも肉を味付けして、加工して乾かしたという点では一緒ですが、味に深みがあって、これもおすすめです。</p>
<h3 id="古着-shirt">古着 &#x1f455;</h3>
<p>あまりファッショナブルな人間ではありませんが、泊まっていた Observatory という街にたくさん古着屋さんがあったので、柄にもなく柄物のシャツや短パンをいくつか買いました。安いし、たくさんあるし、もうちょっと買いたかったかも。ビーチに似合ったコーデが揃いました。</p>
<h2 id="悪かったところと言ってもいいところとも捉えられる">悪かったところ(と言っても、いいところとも捉えられる)</h2>
<p>もちろん、いいところばかりではありません。</p>
<h3 id="交通の便-train">交通の便 &#x1f68b;</h3>
<p>移動はほぼ全て車でした。最初の方はマネージャーが車でいろんなところに連れていってくれましたが、忙しくなってからは、自分で Uber を呼ぶくらいしか自由に移動できないのが少しストレスフルでした。幸いなことに、物価と賃金が安いことから、Uber であっても、街中に行くのは R50<del>100(350</del>700 円)程度で事足ります。最初は少しケチっていましたが、東京で電車に乗るくらいの出費でドアツードアで移動ができると思えば、まだいいのかなと思うようにもなりました。Uber 以外にも Bolt が進出してて、どちらか安い方で移動していました。二人組とかだと安くなって気兼ねなく乗れると思います。それか自分がケチなだけか。</p>
<p>残念なのは電車があるのに発達していないこと。Muizenberg や Simon&rsquo;s Town など、観光客がよく行く半島の南の方に伸びる電車に一度乗りました。来た当初は白人の生徒たちに電車移動はどうかと聞くと、危ないし汚いと勧められはしませんでしたが、公共交通機関大好きな人間としては、一度は試してみないとと思い、Muizenberg から Observatory に帰る際に電車に乗ってみました。チケットは Uber で行ったら片道 R120(約 900 円)くらいかかるところを R9(約 60 円ちょい)と激安です。ですが、電車は 1 時間に 1 度位しか来ないし、駅の間で断続的に止まったりするので遅いし(車 + 30 分)、とても便利とは言えませんでした。ですが、みんなが言うような汚さはなく、何ならバルセロナの電車よりキレイでした。危険性も特には感じないし、感じるのは「何だこのアジア人、珍しいな」みたいなみんなの視線くらいです。あまり急いでない際に乗る分には全然ありかと思いますが、観光のためにリライアブルに使えるとは到底言えないですね。</p>

<h3 id="計画停電-light_bulb">計画停電 :light_bulb:</h3>
<p>南アフリカでは毎日停電があります。国営の電力会社 Eskom が資金をうまく使っていないので、施設の老朽化などが酷く、需要に耐えられないそうです。毎日、地区ごとに断片的に停電をしてなんとか賄っているそうです。停電の長さは、電気が足りてないレベルにもよりますが、僕が居た間は、大体一日に 2 時間の停電が一回だけある事が多かったです。何時に停電するかはアプリが教えてくれて、日によって朝の寝てる時間だったり、昼のエアコンを使いたい時間に停電して死にそうになったり、夜停電して真っ暗で何も見えなかったりなど、色々と不便なこともあります。お店ももちろん停電するので、ホットサンドを頼んでも「ごめん温められない」と言われたり、揚げ物を頼んでもフライヤーが使えないからキャンセルされたり、少しがっかりすることもありました。でも、人っていうのは面白いもので、2 週間もすれば、いつ停電が来ても普通に生活できる様になりました。</p>
<p>また、毎日停電するので、どの家やお店でもキャンドルが必需品となっています。おかげで、レストランなんかに行くとお店の電気は消えていて、店内を照らしているのは各テーブルのキャンドルだけみたいなところが多くあります。これが雰囲気を醸し出してくれて、不便の中にも良さがあるなと、少し感じました。家での食事も、庭のテーブルでキャンドルに照らされて食べるだけで(というかそれ以外手段がない)少しおしゃれな気分になれます。</p>

<h3 id="治安-police_officer">治安 &#x1f46e;</h3>
<p>アメリカみたいに誰か撃たれたみたいなことがしょっちゅうあるわけではありませんが、貧困やホームレス問題がひどいのもあって、窃盗が多いそうです。多いそうと言うか、滞在している間で 3 件周りの人が物を盗まれてました。最初はマネージャーのラップトップ。ブートキャンプで無料セミナーを開催した際に、参加者の一人がテーブルに置いていたマックブックを盗んでいったそうです。このマックブックは紆余曲折を経て、なんとかマネージャーの手元に戻ってきました。これは盗人が計画的にやったのではなく、その場の思いつきでやったことが不幸中の幸いだったのかもしれません。</p>
<p>二件目もそのマネージャー。今度は友人に借りていたラップトップ、スピーカー、財布、車の鍵など色々と入ったバッグをビーチで盗まれていました。バッグを地面に置いて遠くを見て電話している間に気づいたらバッグがなくなっていたそうです。これは警察に届け出ても、たらい回しにされるだけで、一向に進展はなかったそうです。</p>
<p>三件目は、同僚でした。夜寝ている間に、家の前に停めてあった車がそっくりそのまま盗まれてしまいました。鍵もなくよく盗めたなと、感心してしまうくらいです。でも、彼女いわく、前持っていた車も盗まれて無くしたそうです。その時は、なんだかんだ保険金が入ってきたし、売ろうと思ってたからちょうどよかったと言っていたので、今回もそこまで気にしてはいなさそうでした。よくあるんでしょうね。</p>
<p>周りにこれだけ災難が起きていても、自分には特に危険に思うようなことは起きませんでした。とりあえず身の回りに目を配って、戸締まり等をしっかりすれば安全なんじゃないでしょうか。</p>
<h2 id="総じて">総じて</h2>
<p>トントン拍子で来ることが決まって、気づいたらまだ 3 月なのに、今年 2 回も南アフリカに来ていました。でも、家が一番ということで、しばらくの間は南アフリカはいいかなと思っています。でも、もし呼ばれたらまた行くかも。</p>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;リンク切れ&#34;&gt;リンク切れ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TIE の申込みをするのには、警察に行く必要があります。そのためには、事前に予約を取らなければいけません。その情報はどんな How to サイトにも書いてあるのですが、うざいのが、全てにおいて「ここで申し込むんだよ」っていうリンクが切れているということです。リンクが &lt;a href=&#34;https://sede.administracionespublicas.gob.es/icpplustieb/index.html&#34;&gt;https://sede.administracionespublicas.gob.es/icpplustieb/index.html&lt;/a&gt; から &lt;a href=&#34;https://icp.administracionelectronica.gob.es/icpplus/index.html&#34;&gt;https://icp.administracionelectronica.gob.es/icpplus/index.html&lt;/a&gt; に移動したらしく、役所のページの殆どのハイパーリンクがアップデートされてないようです。リダイレクトくらいできただろと思いますが、そこはお役所仕事なのでしょう 🤷‍♀️&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;面接の予約サイトが、誰が考えた UI なんだってくらいゴミです。自分が住んでいる県を選んだ後に、どのオフィスで予約をしたいか選ぶのですが、住所のドロップダウンしか無いというなんとも酷い仕様になっています。どのオフィスが近いのか、一々マップで検索しながら選ぶ必要があるので、とても面倒くさいです。近いオフィスを選んでも、色々と入力させた挙げ句、枠がいっぱいだとエラーになり、最初からやり直しになります 🤬&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;一つ気づいたのは、最初、オフィスを選ぶ画面で、いきなりオフィスを選ぶのではなく、オフィスのところは&lt;code&gt;Cualquier oficina&lt;/code&gt;のままで、&lt;code&gt;TRÁMITES CUERPO NACIONAL DE POLICÍA&lt;/code&gt;だけ、TIE を取りたいというふうにしておけば、名前を入力した画面の後に、スポットが空いているオフィスだけのドロップダウンを出してくれる仕様になっています。最初からこれに気づきたかった… それは Cualquier の意味を知らなかった私のスペイン語力に問題があるのかもしれませんが 😅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;とりあえず予約&#34;&gt;とりあえず予約&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;クソみたいな UI ではありましたが、なんとかバレンタインデー（1.5 ヶ月以上先）に予約が取れました。取れたと言っても、Rubí というバルセロナ中心部からは電車で 40 分くらいかかる場所で、私の家からだと 90 分程度の長旅になります。周りの経験談を聞いてみても、ラッキーであれば中心に近い警察署の予約が取れるのですが、大体が少し郊外の警察署にしか予約が取れないそうです。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tasa-の支払いについて&#34;&gt;Tasa の支払いについて&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;これは少しだけ手こずりましたね。申請に €16 ちょっとを払わないと行けないんですが、銀行に行く必要があります。もし、この時点で、スペインの&amp;quot;ちゃんとした&amp;quot;銀行の口座(Caixa, Santander, Sabadell, etc)を持っている方であれば、&lt;a href=&#34;https://sede.policia.gob.es:38089/Tasa790_012/ImpresoRellenar&#34;&gt;支払いの紙&lt;/a&gt;を作成するときに、支払い方法を現金(en efectivo)ではなく、口座からのデビット(E.C. Adeudo en cuenta)でやったほうが簡単です。そうすれば、紙をプリントアウトする必要もなく、バーコードを携帯に表示できるようにしておけば、Caixa の ATM に行って、バーコードをかざして、NIE 等を打ち込めば、人と話す必要もなく簡単に支払いができます。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ですが、私のように、N26 という少し新し目な銀行口座を持っていると、ちゃんと名目上はスペインの銀行口座なのに、なぜか Caixa の ATM は受け付けてくれません。仕方なく、現金で払うことにしました。ですがまたこれが一苦労。最初、バーコードだけ読めればいいでしょと高をくくって Santander に行ってみたんですが、Santander の機械は紙しか受け付けてくれないとのことなので、仕方なく紙をプリントアウトしに。そして戻ってきたら、Santander の口座を持っていない人には、一日の一定の時間しか対応できないと、追い返されてしまいました。仕方なく、次の日、Sanatnder が口座を持っていない人に対応している時間が AM9:00 から AM10:30 だとのことなので、朝イチで近所の Sanatnder に赴き、ようやく現金で支払う事ができました。もし、スペインの銀行口座をお持ちでない方は、気をつけてください。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

</figure>
</p>
<p>電車で 1 時間以上かけて Rubí に行きました。警察署は思ったより綺麗で、受付の人に&quot;Tengo una cita a las 12:03 para TIE&quot;って言ったら、待合室に通されました。自分の番になったので、中に呼ばれて、担当の職員さんに全て書類を渡しました。警察の人は誰も英語を喋ってくれないと言われていたので、少し心配でしたが、自分の担当だった人は結構流暢な英語を喋れる人でした。なので全部英語で会話しました。</p>
<p>結果を言うと、TIE の申し込みはできませんでした。向こうが色々と情報を入力したあと、TIE の申込みをできる人なら出てくる画面が出てこなかったそうです。なので君は一度バルセロナ市役所の Oficina de Extranjeria に行きなさいと言われました。でも、こっちとしても、1 ヶ月以上待った上に、1 時間以上かけて来ているわけですから、結構食い下がりました。いや、他のワーホリの人はこのまま取れているから自分も取れるはずだ。ワーホリが何か知らないだけで、学生かなんかと間違えてるんじゃないか。かなり反論しましたが、職員の方も、結構キレ気味で、何度も同じことを言わせるなと言ってきたので、仕方なくその日は退散しました。</p>
<p>本当に悔しかったです。きっと自分があたった職員がワーホリの存在を知らなくて、処理し間違えたんだろうと。一度親友に電話して、心を落ち着かせてから、悔しがっても仕方ないと思い、もう一度アポイントメントを取ろうと、最初からやり直しました。</p>
<h3 id="何故か次の日が空いていた">何故か次の日が空いていた</h3>
<p>またゴミ UI の予約画面から来月あたりのスポットが予約できたらいいな、くらいの気持ちでサイトを開いたら、驚くことに、次の日に街の中心にある一番大きい警察署のスロットが一箇所空いていました。誰かが直前にキャンセルしたのかわかりませんが、これは取るしかないと思って速攻で予約しました。</p>
<h3 id="2-回戦">2 回戦</h3>
<figure><img src="/posts/getting-tie/bcn-policia.jpg"><figcaption>
      <h4>メインの警察署。申請が通ったらここに受け取りに来るらしい</h4>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>次の日は、スペイン語ができる友達にもついてきてもらいました。同じように番号が呼ばれるまで待って、順番になったのでブースまで行き、警察官に書類を全部渡しました。今回は英語を喋れない人だったので、友達に会話は全部任せました&#x1f613;</p>
<p>結果は、再度申請不可。職員の人も、前日と一緒で、何かはわからないけど、出てくるはずの画面が出てこない。だから市役所に行ってなにかをしなきゃいけない。だから今日は帰ってくれと。</p>
<p>特に何がだめなのか、よくわからないまま、2 日連続で断れてしまいました。他のワーホリ体験談を見ても、同じようなことを書いている人はいないので、本当にもどかしいです。とりあえず、Rubi の警察官が悪いのではなく、自分のステータスのどこかに TIE の申請を妨げる何かがあることが証明されたので、結果としては良かったのかもしれません。</p>
<h2 id="今後の計画">今後の計画</h2>
<p>今のところは、正直 TIE を取得するのは諦めかけています。取ったところで、実際に Autonomo として登録できるのかはわからないし、社会保障番号を発行できるのかもわからないし、正式な手順を踏んだところで、毎月 €90 を社会保障として払わなきゃいけないしと、先は長いので、正直疲れちゃいました。今のところは日本とそれ以外の案件をやっていこうかなと思っています。スペインまで来て、スペイン以外の仕事しかできない。笑えますね。</p>
<p>もし、リトライすることがあれば、続編を書こうかなと思っています。</p>

            <title>スペインにワーホリビザで来て、エンジニア就活をした話</title>
            <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/getting-a-job-in-spain/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2022 15:31:23 +0100</pubDate>
            
            <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/getting-a-job-in-spain/</guid>
            <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;はじめに&#34;&gt;はじめに&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ワーホリビザで 2022 年の 9 月末にバルセロナに来ました。自分の目標としては、こっちでフルタイムのオファーを貰って、あわよくば就労ビザなりをゲットすること。そんな目標を持って、就活を始めました。この記事では、就活の流れや、何をしたかを書いていきます。ネットを調べても、あまり経験談などを見ないので、自分の備忘録も兼ねて、もし同じことを考えている人の助けになればと思い、書きました。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;自己紹介&#34;&gt;自己紹介&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大学を 2022 年の 8 月に卒業して、何も考えず、スペインに行くことを決めました。日本でバイトの様にやっていたフリーランスの仕事を生活費の足しにするためにリモートで続けつつ、フルタイムの仕事を探しました。
実務経験は、フリーランスとインターンを 1 年半近くやっていました。主にスタートアップサイズの企業で、RoR や Vue.js を使っていました。大学は情報系の出身では無いので、プログラミングの知識はブートキャンプで身につけた後、実務や独学で身につけました。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;どこで職を探したか&#34;&gt;どこで職を探したか&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;linkedin&#34;&gt;Linkedin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;とりあえず、Linkedin をたくさん使いました。面白そうだと思った仕事には積極的にアプライをしていきました。時々、完全に無視されたりなんかもありましたが、毎日企業規模を問わずたくさんのジョブオファーがくるので、いつも眺めていました。Linkedin でプロフィールをしっかりと書いていると、リクルーターからの連絡も来ます。何個か電話に対応して見たものの、最終的にその面談を一回やっただけで、後は音信不通みたいなのが全部でした。下手な鉄砲だと思い、積極的に対応していましたが、結果には繋がりませんでした。人にもよるのかもしれませんね。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;人に会う&#34;&gt;人に会う&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meetup アプリで、飲み会にいくつか参加しました。これはただ友達作りにと思っていたのですが、偶然、ソフトウェア系の会社で働く人と仲良くなりました。彼の働く会社が、ちょうどバルセロナオフィスを設立したばかりだというので、せっかくなので彼を通じて SE のポジションに応募しました。リファーラルはやはり強いですね。トントン拍子で面接も決まり、オフィスにも呼んでもらいました。かなりうまく行ったと思うのですが、残念ながら、会社が ASP.NET メインのスタックだということ（自分経験無し）と、オフィス立ち上げ初期なので、ジュニアよりかはシニアを優先に取るとのことで、また数カ月後に縁があればと、オファーは貰えませんでした。ですが、人との繋がりから、仕事につながる兆しが見えただけでも、いい経験だったと思います。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;就活イベント&#34;&gt;就活イベント&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;バルセロナでやっていたテック系就活イベントにも行ってみました。Eventbrite で見つけたやつです。そこで、一社、ポーランドのコンサル会社の方と話が弾み、Linkedin を交換して、その日のうちにアプライしました。そこは面接をし、コーディングテストをし、テクニカルインタビューを踏んで、今の所 (Dec 28, 2022) 最後の返事待ちです。手応えとしては、やはり Linkedin で何も知らない、やる気あるかわからない状態から就活するよりかは、熱意が伝わるのか、進むのは順調でした。まだオファーを貰ってはいませんが、手応えのあった手法だと思います。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;honeypot&#34;&gt;Honeypot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honeypot が良いとおすすめされたので、登録してみました。Linkedin の逆で、会社があなたを探してくれるサービスです。ですが、おそらく身分不相応な希望年収を書いたので、一度も面接には呼ばれませんでした。少し、戦い方を間違えたなと反省しています。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;その他&#34;&gt;その他&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最終的にオファーを貰ったところは、前述した飲み会で知り合った友人の会社にアプライしたときに、その会社が使っていた応募者用のページを作っているところでした。会社のプロダクトとしては、そういった応募者の管理や、面接の日程を決めたり、HR との連絡をストリームライン化するアプリケーションを作っている会社です。UI が気に入ったので、フッターにあったリンクから、エンジニア募集してないかな？と調べてみたら、ちょうどフルリモートのエンジニアを募集していたので、応募しました。最初にプロダクトマネージャーと 1 時間ほど面接をし、その後、性格診断テストとかんたんなロジカルシンキングテストをやりました。最後に、二人のエンジニアを前に、実務で書いたコードを見せながら、なぜこういうコードを書いたのか、もしもう一度同じことをするなら、何を改善するか、など、プレゼンベースの面接を 1 時間半ほどやりました。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;結論&#34;&gt;結論&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;かなり気力と体力を使いました。リクルーターが音信不通になったり、「どんな言語でもいいからアプリ作って来て」って言われたので Node で書いたら、やっぱ PHP で書いてきて、と言われたり、面接長かったり。後、今後ビサの記事で書こうと思いますが、やはりワーホリビザでいるということを最初にうまく伝えておくのは大切だと感じました。そうすれば、自分側も、向こう側も、なんだかんだ無駄にする時間が減ると思います。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;追記-20230109---ワーホリだからオファーを取り下げられた&#34;&gt;追記 (2023/01/09) - ワーホリだからオファーを取り下げられた&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I apologize for the delay in the replay. I checked and unfortunately with our current resources it won’t be possible. ☹
I hope we stay in touch though and when we have more possibilities, we can cooperate again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="はじめに">はじめに</h2>
<p>ワーホリビザで 2022 年の 9 月末にバルセロナに来ました。自分の目標としては、こっちでフルタイムのオファーを貰って、あわよくば就労ビザなりをゲットすること。そんな目標を持って、就活を始めました。この記事では、就活の流れや、何をしたかを書いていきます。ネットを調べても、あまり経験談などを見ないので、自分の備忘録も兼ねて、もし同じことを考えている人の助けになればと思い、書きました。</p>
<h2 id="自己紹介">自己紹介</h2>
<p>大学を 2022 年の 8 月に卒業して、何も考えず、スペインに行くことを決めました。日本でバイトの様にやっていたフリーランスの仕事を生活費の足しにするためにリモートで続けつつ、フルタイムの仕事を探しました。
実務経験は、フリーランスとインターンを 1 年半近くやっていました。主にスタートアップサイズの企業で、RoR や Vue.js を使っていました。大学は情報系の出身では無いので、プログラミングの知識はブートキャンプで身につけた後、実務や独学で身につけました。</p>
<h2 id="どこで職を探したか">どこで職を探したか</h2>
<h3 id="linkedin">Linkedin</h3>
<p>とりあえず、Linkedin をたくさん使いました。面白そうだと思った仕事には積極的にアプライをしていきました。時々、完全に無視されたりなんかもありましたが、毎日企業規模を問わずたくさんのジョブオファーがくるので、いつも眺めていました。Linkedin でプロフィールをしっかりと書いていると、リクルーターからの連絡も来ます。何個か電話に対応して見たものの、最終的にその面談を一回やっただけで、後は音信不通みたいなのが全部でした。下手な鉄砲だと思い、積極的に対応していましたが、結果には繋がりませんでした。人にもよるのかもしれませんね。</p>
<h3 id="人に会う">人に会う</h3>
<p>Meetup アプリで、飲み会にいくつか参加しました。これはただ友達作りにと思っていたのですが、偶然、ソフトウェア系の会社で働く人と仲良くなりました。彼の働く会社が、ちょうどバルセロナオフィスを設立したばかりだというので、せっかくなので彼を通じて SE のポジションに応募しました。リファーラルはやはり強いですね。トントン拍子で面接も決まり、オフィスにも呼んでもらいました。かなりうまく行ったと思うのですが、残念ながら、会社が ASP.NET メインのスタックだということ（自分経験無し）と、オフィス立ち上げ初期なので、ジュニアよりかはシニアを優先に取るとのことで、また数カ月後に縁があればと、オファーは貰えませんでした。ですが、人との繋がりから、仕事につながる兆しが見えただけでも、いい経験だったと思います。</p>
<h3 id="就活イベント">就活イベント</h3>
<p>バルセロナでやっていたテック系就活イベントにも行ってみました。Eventbrite で見つけたやつです。そこで、一社、ポーランドのコンサル会社の方と話が弾み、Linkedin を交換して、その日のうちにアプライしました。そこは面接をし、コーディングテストをし、テクニカルインタビューを踏んで、今の所 (Dec 28, 2022) 最後の返事待ちです。手応えとしては、やはり Linkedin で何も知らない、やる気あるかわからない状態から就活するよりかは、熱意が伝わるのか、進むのは順調でした。まだオファーを貰ってはいませんが、手応えのあった手法だと思います。</p>
<h3 id="honeypot">Honeypot</h3>
<p>Honeypot が良いとおすすめされたので、登録してみました。Linkedin の逆で、会社があなたを探してくれるサービスです。ですが、おそらく身分不相応な希望年収を書いたので、一度も面接には呼ばれませんでした。少し、戦い方を間違えたなと反省しています。</p>
<h3 id="その他">その他</h3>
<p>最終的にオファーを貰ったところは、前述した飲み会で知り合った友人の会社にアプライしたときに、その会社が使っていた応募者用のページを作っているところでした。会社のプロダクトとしては、そういった応募者の管理や、面接の日程を決めたり、HR との連絡をストリームライン化するアプリケーションを作っている会社です。UI が気に入ったので、フッターにあったリンクから、エンジニア募集してないかな？と調べてみたら、ちょうどフルリモートのエンジニアを募集していたので、応募しました。最初にプロダクトマネージャーと 1 時間ほど面接をし、その後、性格診断テストとかんたんなロジカルシンキングテストをやりました。最後に、二人のエンジニアを前に、実務で書いたコードを見せながら、なぜこういうコードを書いたのか、もしもう一度同じことをするなら、何を改善するか、など、プレゼンベースの面接を 1 時間半ほどやりました。</p>
<h2 id="結論">結論</h2>
<p>かなり気力と体力を使いました。リクルーターが音信不通になったり、「どんな言語でもいいからアプリ作って来て」って言われたので Node で書いたら、やっぱ PHP で書いてきて、と言われたり、面接長かったり。後、今後ビサの記事で書こうと思いますが、やはりワーホリビザでいるということを最初にうまく伝えておくのは大切だと感じました。そうすれば、自分側も、向こう側も、なんだかんだ無駄にする時間が減ると思います。</p>
<h2 id="追記-20230109---ワーホリだからオファーを取り下げられた">追記 (2023/01/09) - ワーホリだからオファーを取り下げられた</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I apologize for the delay in the replay. I checked and unfortunately with our current resources it won’t be possible. ☹
I hope we stay in touch though and when we have more possibilities, we can cooperate again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>オファーを頂いていたポーランドのコンサル会社から、やはりワーホリビザじゃ働かせられないし、就労ビザの手続きもしたくないから、やっぱりごめんとのメールを頂きました。オファーも、€22000 と、スウェーデンの会社に比べて 150 万円ほど安かったので、正直あまり選ぶ気はありませんでしたが、やはりビザ面倒くさいからごめんと言われるとしゃくですね…</p>
<h2 id="追記-2-20231-月中旬---ワーホリだから契約できないとなったけど代替案を提示された">追記 2 (2023/1 月中旬) - ワーホリだから契約できないとなったけど、代替案を提示された</h2>
<p>オファーを頂いたスウェーデンの会社ですが、1 月からスタートする予定だったんですが、契約書を用意する段階で、向こうから今のビザでは雇うことができないという悲しいメールが来ました。ワーホリでフルタイムはやはり会社としては無理なんですね。おそらく契約に終了がないのがいけないんでしょうか。</p>
<p>こちらとしても、インターンや、パートタイム契約ならどうだと、少しごねては見ましたが、向こうの雇用フィロソフィーと合わないということもあって、今すぐスタートするのは見送ることになりました。ですが、その後マネージャーと面談をした結果、とても寛大な提案をしていただきました。</p>
<ol>
<li>なる早でスタートするために、スウェーデンに引っ越して、スウェーデンの就労ビザを申し込む。こうすれば、会社としても経験豊富だし、オフィスに来て働ける。</li>
<li>少しスペインに飽きるまで居て、数カ月後にスウェーデンに行って、同じことをする。そうすればスペインを十分に満喫してから、仕事を始められる。</li>
<li>ワーホリビザが切れるまで待って、それからスペインの就労ビザを取得して、リモートでスペインから働く。</li>
</ol>
<p>大変光栄なことに、向こうは僕のポテンシャルに期待してくれているそうで、「待つに値する」とまで言ってくれました。自分は、スペインに来て間もないし、スペイン語もまだ満足に喋れないので、お金を使って今すぐにスウェーデンに行く決心はできないと伝えました。結果、3 のワーホリビザが切れる 9 月まで待って、日本で就労ビザを取得して、早ければ 2023 年以内、もし時間がかかるようであれば 2024 年からスタートするということで合意しました。なので、とりあえずそれまではフリーランスを続ければいいのかな。</p>

            <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;before-we-begin&#34;&gt;Before we begin&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-this&#34;&gt;What is this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a tutorial to get started with VueJS, a most liked Javascript front-end framework on Github. In this tutorial, we will cover the basic concepts of the framework, which can translate to other front-end frameworks, such as React or Angular. You can start your front-end journey from Vue 👍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-vue&#34;&gt;What is Vue?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VueJS is a Open source Javascript front-end framework which helps you to make interactive single page applications (SPAs). It is one of the most liked JS framework and there are many companies and applications that are powered by Vue. To raise some examples, Glovo, Gitlab and few other big name companies use this framework, according to &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackshare.io/vue-js&#34;&gt;stack share&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike other popular frameworks, such as Angular and React, Vue is not founded by a big corporation. It is truly open source and the amount of community made Vue extensions are limitless. Another notable pros of Vue is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://vuejs.org/&#34;&gt;well written documentation&lt;/a&gt; with full of examples. If you are ever stuck on a concept or a bug, always check the documentation because it really helps. Enough with what Vue is, lets get started with the tutorial. &lt;span  class=&#34;inline-svg mdi insentence&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; xmlns:xlink=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&#34; version=&#34;1.1&#34; id=&#34;mdi-vuejs&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34;&gt;&lt;path fill=&#34;currentColor&#34; d=&#34;M2,3H5.5L12,15L18.5,3H22L12,21L2,3M6.5,3H9.5L12,7.58L14.5,3H17.5L12,13.08L6.5,3Z&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;

<h2 id="folder-structure">Folder structure</h2>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s take a look at the folder structure.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span>.

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>├── vite.config.js
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>└── yarn.lock
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In Vue, there are three most important files, <code>index.html</code>, <code>main.js</code> and <code>App.vue</code>. Let&rsquo;s see how the app gets rendered.</p>
<p>First, like any other website, <code>index.html</code> is the starting point. This is the html server will send to the client. Take look at the file</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">&lt;!-- index.html --&gt;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">body</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>	&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">div</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">id</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;app&#34;</span>&gt;&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">div</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>	&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">script</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">type</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;module&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">src</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/src/main.js&#34;</span>&gt;&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">script</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">body</span>&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>However, as you can see, there is only one <code>div</code> in the body, and the rest is the <code>script</code> tag to load JS.
This is because we are drawing the entire application using Javascript, inside that <code>div#app</code>.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s see how that happens in <code>main.js</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">// main.js
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">import</span> { <span style="color:#a6e22e">createApp</span> } <span style="color:#a6e22e">from</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;vue&#34;</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">createApp</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">App</span>).<span style="color:#a6e22e">mount</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;#app&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here is where Vue is started. <code>createApp</code> is function where Vue application gets initiated. It uses the <code>App.vue</code> file, which is the root of the application. Then, it mounts onto the <code>div#app</code> element we saw in <code>index.html</code>. Thanks to this <code>mount</code> action, we can now use Vue (JS) to draw the page, whilst adding interactive features.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s look at our first Vue file.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">&lt;!-- App.vue --&gt;</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There are three sections in Vue files. <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;style&gt;</code>. Each sections are pretty self explanatory.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s begin with the easiest one: <code>&lt;style&gt;</code>. In between <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags, we can write CSS like we normally do in css files. However, unlike css files, we can choose different types of css, such as scss or less. All you have to do is to specify the language in lang attribute, and install a loader, which for this project, I&rsquo;ve already done for scss so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about it. Also, you can <code>scope</code> your styles, meaning that the styles you define within this file will not apply to other file&rsquo;s elements, even if they have the same class names. For instance, even if you have a <code>div</code> with class <code>container</code> in other Vue file, it will not apply the styling defined in <code>App.vue</code>.</p>
<p>Now, onto the template. As you can see, template is where you write your html. You can just write html you&rsquo;re used to. However, as we discuss later, something more than just html is possible here. Later, we will learn how we can mix Javascript and html together in the template section.</p>
<p>Lastly, the script section. This is where you write your Javascript. This is where you define the attributes and behaviors of this Vue component. You can think this like a controller in Stimulus, or a model in Rails, or mix of both.</p>
<h2 id="components">Components</h2>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s talk about the most important concept in Vue: Components. Components are the building blocks of Vue. You can think of it as a partial in Rails. After you define a component, you can reuse it anywhere in the app.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s think about what components we need in this todo list app.</p>

            <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;条件&#34;&gt;条件&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;銀行口座&#34;&gt;銀行口座&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;銀行の国にこだわりが無く、ユーロを受け取ったり、ATM で引き落としたりする口座の場合は特になし&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;スペインの銀行口座を開きたければ、NIE が必要&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;携帯番号&#34;&gt;携帯番号&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;スペインの携帯番号のある友人&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;住所が決まってると便利かも&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;銀行口座の取得&#34;&gt;銀行口座の取得&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wise&#34;&gt;Wise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;海外移住を考えている人は、必ず Wise の存在をご存知なんじゃないでしょうか？ほぼマーケットと同じ為替レートで各国の通貨を換金することができます。また、一つの Wise アカウントで通貨ごとの&amp;quot;銀行口座&amp;quot;を作ることができます。私も、Wise 上でユーロの銀行口座を開き、Wise のアプリ上でブリュッセルに銀行口座が開かれたことを確認できました。移住後に給料を支払うために、雇用者から IBAN などを聞かれたら、Wise 上のユーロ口座の IBAN を伝えれば、そこに直接給料が振り込まれます。また、日本で Wise のカードを ¥2000 ゲットすれば、スーパーなどの買い物で使えます。その際には自動的にユーロの口座からデビットで引き落とされます。一番驚いたのが、日本円-&amp;gt;ユーロの両替のスピードです。手順としては&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wise で自分のユーロの口座にいくら送りたいか入力する&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;日本円で Wise 宛(Paypay 銀行の口座)にいくら振り込めばいいか伝えられる&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;言われた額と同じ額を自分の銀行のオンラインバンキングを使って振り込む（この際に日本の銀行に振込手数料は取られる。だが、銀行の国際送金の手数料に比べれば微々たるもの。また SBI 住信等、振込手数料タダの銀行の口座があれば勿論タダ。）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wise 側で、振り込みが完了したことを伝える&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;この手順を踏めば、私の場合、当日中に指定した額のユーロが自分の口座に入っていました。 Wise で日本円を USD にしたことがあるデンスが、その際は 2~3 日かかったので、この速さには驚きました。
こっちで現金を ATM から引き落としたければ、前述した ¥2000 の Wise カードを日本で手に入れる必要があります。また、日本の Wise は Google Pay などに対応していないので、物理カードをゲットしておくことが無難なのではないでしょうか？(Edit: 2024 年現在、Wise アプリでバーチャルカードに対応したので、バーチャルカードを作り、それを直接 Google Pay に追加できるようになりました。なので、NFC 決済もできます。)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;n26&#34;&gt;N26&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wise は普段の生活に支障は無いかもしれませんが、一つだけネックなのは、ユーロ口座が実質ベルギーの口座になってしまっているということです。後述する携帯電話の契約をした際に、スペインの銀行の IBAN でないと受け付けないと弾かれてしまいました。今後もそういった事例が発生するかとも思い、スペインの銀行口座を開くことにしました。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;目をつけたのは、N26。理由としては、オーストリアの友人がおすすめしていたから。ここも、有名なオンラインバーチャルバンクの一種で、バーチャルであるからこそ、実際の銀行のような煩雑な現地での手続きなどを踏まなくて良いと思い試してみました。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<h3 id="n26">N26</h3>
<p>Wise は普段の生活に支障は無いかもしれませんが、一つだけネックなのは、ユーロ口座が実質ベルギーの口座になってしまっているということです。後述する携帯電話の契約をした際に、スペインの銀行の IBAN でないと受け付けないと弾かれてしまいました。今後もそういった事例が発生するかとも思い、スペインの銀行口座を開くことにしました。</p>
<p>目をつけたのは、N26。理由としては、オーストリアの友人がおすすめしていたから。ここも、有名なオンラインバーチャルバンクの一種で、バーチャルであるからこそ、実際の銀行のような煩雑な現地での手続きなどを踏まなくて良いと思い試してみました。</p>
<p>手順は、アプリをダウンロードして、口座を開設する国にスペインを選択し NIE や住所の情報を入力するだけ。後は、本人認証のために、パスポートの写しなどを指示に従ってアップロードし、承認されるのを待つだけ。申請して数時間も経たないうちに受理されました。</p>
<p>ちなみに、N26 はビジネスバージョンだったり、一月にいくらか払うと、ATM で現金をおろせる回数が増えたりなど、プランを選ぶことができます。私はとりあえず月額無料のビジネスのバーチャルカードを選びました。なぜなら、安いし、申請した当時は日本に居たので、物理カードを受け取る術がないから。現地に行って、必要を感じたら 10 ユーロ払ってカードを貰えばいいやと思っていました。ちなみに、これを書いている現在、スペインで一週間バーチャルカードを使って過ごしていますが、特に問題はありません。どのお店も NFC のリーダーを持っているので、携帯さえ持っていれば、とりあえず支払いはできます。もしできなくても、バックアップに Wise の物理カードがあるので、今の所、現金を使わなくてはいけない場面には出くわしていません。</p>
<p>今の所、N26 には Wise からお金を振り込む形でチャージをしています。手数料はかかりますが、いくら Wise から送金しても、€0.28 と微々たるものなので、特に気にせずにチャージしてます。</p>
<p>これでめでたくスペインの銀行口座をゲットすることができました。次に、N26 で手に入れたスペインの IBAN で携帯の契約をすることにしました。</p>
<h2 id="携帯番号-1">携帯番号</h2>
<p>まずは、携帯のキャリアをいくつか調べました。どの会社も 20GB とかけ放題で €20 くらいのプランが多く、日本の大手キャリアに比べれば安いと感じるものが多かったです。他にも面白い特典などもあり、例えば、Vodafone のプランは、週末はデータがカウントされないそうです。他にも、値段で見れば、MVNO がやはり安いです。Lowi なんかだと、20GB かけ放題で €10 くらいのプランなんかもありました。</p>
<p>その中で私は Movistar の電波を使っている MVNO(イギリスなんかだと大手キャリアですが)O2 を選びました。選んだ理由としては、</p>
<ul>
<li>5G が使える</li>
<li>値段がまあ妥当 (€10/month)
<ul>
<li>20GB</li>
<li>電話し放題</li>
<li>SMS 送り放題</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>eSIM が使える</li>
<li>名前を知ってる</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nperf.com/en/map/ES/-/168910.Movistar-Movil/signal/?ll=39.143907559644944&amp;lg=-1.813774108886719&amp;zoom=6">カバレージ</a>が、Vodafone より広い
です。</li>
</ul>
<p>カバレージに関しては、バルセロナの町中に入る分にはあまり関係ないかもしれませんが、上にリンクしたマップを見る限り、田舎道なんかのカバレージと 5G の電波塔の範囲では、Movistar が勝っているのがわかると思います。
東京で 5G の速さに慣れてしまったので、正直 5G をカバーしていないプランは考えていませんでした。後、ついた瞬間に使えるという安心感が欲しかったので、海外からでもアクティベートできそうな O2 を選びました。</p>
<h2 id="入手方法">入手方法</h2>
<p>入手方法は至って簡単で、O2 の申し込みのページで、名前、生年月日、NIE、さっき入手した N26 のスペインの銀行口座情報などを入力するだけ。一つだけトリッキーなのが、連絡用の電話番号を入力しなくてはいけないこと。「電話番号が無いんだから申し込むんだろうが」ってツッコみたくなりますが、日本の番号は受け付けてくれないので、仕方なく移住前から連絡を取っていたルームメイトに Whatsapp で許可を取り、彼の電話番号を入力しました。そうすると、認証コードが彼の元に行くので、Whatsapp で教えてもらい、認証を完了させました。ルームメイトがいなかったら、現地で Vodafone のストアで契約するとかしかできなかったでしょう。</p>
<p>申込みが完了し、後は個人の認証のために、指定されたメールアドレスに自分のビザの写しと NIE の通知書を添付して送信しました。そしたら、数日後に自分の電話番号が書かれた PDF が送られてきて、その中にある QR コードを使って eSIM をダウンロードすれば完了です。O2 のプランには、ヨーロッパ内でのローミングしか無いので、その場で接続を確認することはできませんでした。ですが、実際にバルセロナに着陸した瞬間、飛行機の中で LINE の通知を勝手に受信し始めたときは、安心しました。入国してからは、SMS、電話、データ通信は全く問題ありません。もちろん、日本の様なカバレージは期待していないので、ピソの部屋からのデータ通信はとても遅いですが、道でマップを使う等、問題なく利用できています。バルセロナの中心部では、4G でもダウンロード 120Mbps くらい出ます。申し分ないです。地下鉄でも、あまり途切れることなく使えます。</p>
<p>口座開設や、携帯の契約などは、スペインに来てからでも十分かもしれませんが、工夫すれば日本にいるうちにできるので、時間節約のためにも是非試してみて下さい。</p>

            <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/spain-visa/</link>
            <pubDate>Thu, 22 Sep 2022 02:49:30 +0900</pubDate>
            
            <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/spain-visa/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;ちょうどフリーランスエンジニアとして、東京でも少しずつ自信がついてきたので、いっそのことどこかに移住してトライして見よう。ということで、バルセロナに引っ越すことにしました。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;下準備&#34;&gt;下準備&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 月に大学を卒業するので、準備期間なども含めて、9 月の下旬に飛び立つことを決定。大使館 HP にも書いてあるように、ワーホリビザには、事前に航空券を買っておく必要があります。なので、適当に 9 月頃の一番安いチケットをスカイスキャナーで探し、購入。他にも、行動の計画表や、外国人番号の登録申請書など、とりあえず HP に書けと言われているものはすべて書く。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;予定表は、何をどれくらい詳しく書けば良いのかもわからなかったので、本当にざっくりと書きました。一応欄は 10 個くらいあるのですが、私は、&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9~12 月、仕事。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;年末年始あたり、旅行。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 月以降、仕事。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;という、仕事する気満々の予定を書きました。これの是非については、また後ほど。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ビザ申請に行った&#34;&gt;ビザ申請に行った。&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 月の初旬、当時住んでいた秋田県から東京に帰郷し、六本木一丁目駅の近くにあるスペイン大使館までビザの申請をしに行きました。まず、トリッキーなのが、六本木一丁目の駅の構造。後ほど話すように、3 回訪れて気づいたのは、地下鉄の出口の目の前にある外にあるエスカレーターをまっすぐ上に上がって、おしゃれな HARIO のカフェを左手に見ながら、スウェーデン大使館が見えるまで直進し、左折すると左手にスペイン大使館があります。入り口は蔦が生い茂っていて、少し見えにくくなっていますが、門をくぐると、直ぐにセキュリティの方が話しかけてくれます。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;スペイン留学をした友人が、朝イチで行かないととても混むという情報をくれたのですが、早起きすることもできず、10 時過ぎころに到着したと思います。ですが、思ったよりも混んでおらず、10 分も待たないうちに自分の番が来ました。おそらく、夏休みなどのピークのとき以外は、意外と空いているようです。以後、夏休み以外の季節に 2 回訪れましたが、いずれも、15 分以上は待たされませんでした。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;窓口では持ってきた書類を出し、窓口の人が確認し、お金を払うという簡単なものです。ですが、二つ指摘を受けました。一つ言われたのが、計画書が仕事メインすぎるということ。「働きすぎると違法就労に当たりますから気をつけてください」と釘を刺されました &amp;#x1f605; もう一つは、完全なミス。医者の診断書の日付をもらい忘れたので、もう一度医者に行って、書いてもらって、上から病院印を押して郵送してくれとのこと。これは完全に余計な手間を増やしてしまい、痛恨のミスでした。日付はお忘れなく。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;後は待つ&#34;&gt;後は待つ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;パスポートも取り上げられ、窓口では、「8 週間後には準備できています。メールが来たらまた出頭してください」と言われました。Twitter などを漁ってみると、意外と早く来ただとか、４週間もせずに準備ができたなどの情報もあったので、のんきに一ヶ月位でメールが来るだろうと高をくくっていました。ですが&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;来ない&#34;&gt;来ない。&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一ヶ月経っても来ない。まぁ８週間って言ってたし、とりあえずそれまで待ってみる。ですが、7 週間目の月曜日になっても、一向に連絡が来る気配がなし。フライトが３週間後程に迫ってきていたので、こちらも少し心配になり、電話をしてみることにしました。水曜日に電話をしたんですが、自動音声ガイダンスに従って、領事部に連絡を入れようとしても、混み合っているとのことで一向に繋がらない。数分おいて再びトライしても、繋がらない。最終的に夕方まで待ってみると、繋がりました。でも、自動音声ガイダンスも 3 回目だったので、適当に番号を打っていたので、もしかすると違う部署にかけてしまってたかもしれません&amp;#x1f605; だから繋がったのかな… とりあえず、事情を説明してみると、「8 週間待って下さいって言われたんですよね？だったら 8 週間待ってから電話して下さい。」と取り合ってもくれませんでした。出国の 1 週間前くらいになったら、状況を確認してくれると言われました。僕のパスポートを持ってるわけだし、もう少し丁寧に対応してほしいと思う反面、お役所なんてそんなもんだよね、と諦めました。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;でも気になるので大使館に行ってみた&#34;&gt;でも気になるので、大使館に行ってみた&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;でも、8 週間を過ぎた月曜日、ちょうど仕事もなかったので、六本木の大使館に行ってみました。スペイン留学をした友人が、学生ビザに関しても、全然連絡が来なかったので、試しに問い合わせてみたら、もう準備はできていて、連絡が行ってなかっただけということがあったと言っていたので、少しそのケースを期待していました。ですが、電話のときと同じく、連絡が行っていないのは準備ができていないからだと言われてしまいました。他に言われたのは、&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;一人ずつ状況を確認してあげることはできない&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9 月は留学ビザのピークなので、出国当日に準備できるなんてケースもあるくらい忙しい&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8 週間とは言ったものの、それはあくまで目安。もっとかかるかもしれない&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;出国 1 週間前とかになったら、もう一度問い合わせてくれとのこと&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;この様に、わざわざ六本木に行っても、あまり掛け合ってはくれませんでした。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;85-週間でやっと発給された&#34;&gt;8.5 週間でやっと発給された&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;門前払いを食らってしまった 2 日後、やっとビザが発給されたとのメールが来ました。果たして 2 回も問い合わせたことに意味があったのかはわかりませんが、とりあえず無事にパスポートを取り返すことができてよかったです。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>以上が私が個人的に経験したスペインのワーキングホリデービザを取得するまでの道のりでした。
しっかりと時間に余裕を持って申請することが大切ですね。言われた時間よりも長くかかるとはネットの情報からするとあまり考えていなかったので、かなり日にちに余裕を持った飛行機のチケットを買っておいてよかったです。</p>

<p>It seems that it is based off of the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50288034/unsatisfiedlinkerror-tmp-snappy-1-1-4-libsnappyjava-so-error-loading-shared-li">stackoverflow article</a> but tbh, I have no idea why it did the fix.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just noting here so that someone who might have a similar problem can fix it. Or, future me might benefit from it once I remake the Dockerfile for another practice run &#x1f605;</p>
