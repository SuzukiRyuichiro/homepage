        <h2 id="film-development-in-japan-is-getting-worse-and-more-expensive">Film development in Japan is getting worse and more expensive</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been developing film with mostly Kitamura, one of the biggest photo printing chain in Japan. Many stores in Tokyo have in-store developer and scanner and they would develop, scan and give you a QR code from which you can download the results. I used to like the quality and how easy it is to use. However, I&rsquo;ve noticed that recently, they increased the price for a higher quality scan, and they made the cheaper scanning option&rsquo;s quality so low. Also, the scans had too much contrast most of the times. On top of that, they usually can do C41 in 2~4 hours but when you ask for B&amp;W, they tell you that they have to send it to a factory and develop it there, hence the time it takes bumps up to 2+ weeks.</p>
<p>Given those circumstances, I decided to dip my toe into the rabbit hole of developing at home. It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve wanted to do for a while anyways, and it brings down the cost of developing.</p>

<p>The reasons for the chemicals were simply it was available. One mistake I realized after the purchase was that the shelf life for the developer is 2 month in a half full bottle. I got 5 litre bottle to store it so I need to use the developer a lot in that 2 month. I definitely will get a smaller bottle and go with a litre developer powders the next time. I blame the guy at the store because I asked him which one to get and told him that it&rsquo;s my first time developing, yet he gave me this option.</p>
<p>For the tank, I see a lot of Youtubers are using patterson tanks, but they weren&rsquo;t readily available in Japan. I came across this Chinese brand and the reviews were good, and it seemed to have the same out-to-in mechanism when loading the film, instead of the in-to-out of the old-school steel reels. As a first-timer, that was the biggest concern, putting film onto the reels in the dark. After I got the thing, I tried with the negatives already developed, and it was fairly easy to load them even in the bag. I highly recommend this if you cannot find a patterson tank.</p>
<h2 id="what-im-developing">What I&rsquo;m developing</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing a Lomography Lady Grey 400 which I went around several different stores across Tokyo but all of them said it&rsquo;s gonna take 2 weeks.</p>
<h2 id="setting-things-up">Setting things up</h2>
<h3 id="developer">Developer</h3>
<p>I will have to make the powder into 3.8 litre water first.</p>
<p>I will put 375ml of the solution aside as is written at the bottom of the tank</p>
<h3 id="fixer">Fixer</h3>
<p>For the Rapid Fixer by Ilford, I will prepare in 1:4 ratio, so 75ml of the solution, and 300ml of water.</p>
<h3 id="wetting-agent">Wetting agent</h3>
<p>Ilfotol has 1 : 200 dilution, and since the tank needs 375ml, I would need 1.87ml of the solution diluted up to 375ml. For this, I don&rsquo;t have enough equipment to measure so I will do 2 grams of the solution. In the future, I want to get a pipet to measure 2ml precisely.</p>

<h2 id="developing">Developing</h2>
<h3 id="loading-up">Loading up</h3>
<p>This was the part I was most scared about, but it was easier than I thought. I put the tank, film, film opener and scissors into the dark bag, then I turned the light off (just in case) and loaded the film by just feeling it. One thing I&rsquo;m glad that I did was that I practiced loading before with already developed film from before. Although it was cut into a smaller strip, it was still useful to practice the feel for the slot to put the beginning of the film in.</p>

<h3 id="pre-rinse">Pre-rinse</h3>
<p>After sealing the tank, I rinsed the film with water because a Youtuber said to do so.</p>
<h3 id="develop">Develop</h3>
<p>Development time for <a href="https://www.lomography.com/magazine/94343-lady-grey-and-earl-grey-development-times">Lomography Lady Grey 400 with Kodak D-76 at 20 degrees celsius is 7.5 minutes</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pour the developer into the tank</li>
<li>Give agitation for 10 seconds</li>
<li>Every 30 seconds, give agitation for 5 seconds and smack down from 2.5cm height to get rid of the bubbles</li>
<li>Pour out the developer</li>
<li>Give a lot of water into the tank. This is in place for the stop bath</li>
<li>Pour in the fixer</li>
<li>Do the agitation and smack every minute for 2–5 minutes. I will do 4 just to be on the safe side not to degrade the film</li>
<li>Pour them out into a beaker.</li>
<li>Give another good rinse with water to get rid of the chemicals</li>
<li>Pour in the wetting agent</li>
<li>After about 30 seconds of swishing around, pull them out</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="drying">Drying</h3>
<p>After the process is done, I hung the roll in a closet. I got the film hanging clips because they were cheap but I guess it is not a necessity. I didn&rsquo;t ge the squeegee but I think it dried out fine.</p>

<h3 id="scanning">Scanning</h3>
<p>After the film was dried, I scanned my film using my Olympus OME EM5 Mk-2 and Lomography&rsquo;s scanning thingy. It is still a struggle to get a good quality for scan. I went stingy on macro option so I just have an attachment which makes my zoom lens into a &ldquo;macro&rdquo; lens.</p>
<p>Another difficulty is the build quality of the scanning board from Lomography. For the price they charge, the thing is bit too flimsy and also the AA battery doesn&rsquo;t light the backlight enough. I use my mobile battery to directly power the back light.</p>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>After scanning, I don&rsquo;t wanna pay for Adobe so I used Snapseed to turn the negatives into positives. Here, it is another struggle to get the edit right. I am always never satisfied with the result but I guess that&rsquo;s another process to enjoy. Previously, it was hating on Kitamura&rsquo;s edit but now I have only myself to blame 😝</p>

<h2 id="end">End</h2>
<p>The whole process was easier than I thought. I don&rsquo;t know what I was afraid of. Now I&rsquo;m waiting for C41 chemicals to come as well. I know it will be slightly more effort since you need to keep the temperature high and need more chemicals but shall be fine.</p>
