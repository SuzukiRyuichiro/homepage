      <description>My first DIY keyboard build I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking into ergonomic mechanical keyboards for a while, and I finally made one. I chose Lily58 since it seemed to be not too far from the normal keyboard layout while having a lot of thumb keys, which is what I wanted. I heavily use keyboard shortcuts while working, and this layout looked promising.&#xA;I got the keyboard set that is not pre-assembled, as I wanted to keep it under budget and also enjoy the challenge of soldering all the switches and diodes.</description>
