  content="TLDR I am a full-stack web developer. I have experience in developing web apps and native mobile apps. I am also a teacher at a coding boot camp. I am a Japanese / English bilingual 🇯🇵🇬🇧
Long version Where am I from? I was born in Tokyo, Japan and grew up there until the age of 10. In 2010, my family moved to London and I spent three years living in Wimbledon, where I acquired my English accent. After those three years, we relocated to Ljubljana, Slovenia, where I lived for two more years. In 2015, I returned to Japan to attend high school in Ehime, a prefecture in western Japan. For college, I studied at Akita International University, a liberal arts college located in northern Japan. During the summer of 2019, I participated in an exchange program and studied at George Washington University in Washington D.C., USA. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I returned to Tokyo and have been in the greater Tokyo area since. In the summer of 2022, I moved to Spain. Currently, I am based in Barcelona, working as a freelance software engineer.
