      <description>The problem In the coding boot camp I teach at, one of the students was using a Pinterest&amp;rsquo;s widget for their final project. However, they had an issue where the widget wouldn&amp;rsquo;t show up on their page if the page was reached through clicking on a link within the app. However, it would show up if they reloaded the page.&#xA;The cause Cause is kind of obvious but turbo. If you follow the instruction on Pinterest&amp;rsquo;s installation guide, you would put an &amp;lt;a&amp;gt; tag to the place you want to mount your widget, and put an &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; tag at the end of the &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;.</description>

      <description>The issue I have a Rails application that runs on Ruby alpine image. When I was running github actions workflow, it threw an error when installing gems. The workflow file is basically the copy of the official Ruby on Rails CI template, which you can easily find from Github Actions tab on any repo. When it hits the point where installing gems using bundle install, it stops with&#xA;Error: The process &amp;#39;/opt/hostedtoolcache/Ruby/3.</description>
