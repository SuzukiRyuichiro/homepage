      <description>&lt;img src=&#34;https://ryuichirosuzuki.com/posts/how-to-get-to-suzuka-from-nagoya/header.jpg&#34;  alt=&#34;Suzuka Circuit&#34;  class=&#34;center &#34;  style=&#34;border-radius: 8px;&#34;  /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given the recent increase in the popularity of Formula 1, there are plenty of non-Japanese speakers visiting the Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka. This year, I went for the first time, but it was hard to figure out how to get to the circuit, and where to get the ticket from online resources. It was confusing even to me, a fluent Japanese speaker, so it must be more confusing for people visiting from abroad. In this blog, I will try my best to list all possible way to get to the circuit from Nagoya, which is one of the closest major cities where many other fans and media personnel stay. Many people choose Nagoya since any hotels closer to the circuit are fully booked even before the tickets goes on sale ðŸ¤¯ Also, I will list some other possible solutions which I might want to try in the coming years if I ever visit again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
