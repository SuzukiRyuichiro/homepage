      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;film-development-in-japan-is-getting-worse-and-more-expensive&#34;&gt;Film development in Japan is getting worse and more expensive&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been developing film with mostly Kitamura, one of the biggest photo printing chain in Japan. Many stores in Tokyo have in-store developer and scanner and they would develop, scan and give you a QR code from which you can download the results. I used to like the quality and how easy it is to use. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that recently, they increased the price for a higher quality scan, and they made the cheaper scanning option&amp;rsquo;s quality so low. Also, the scans had too much contrast most of the times. On top of that, they usually can do C41 in 2~4 hours but when you ask for B&amp;amp;W, they tell you that they have to send it to a factory and develop it there, hence the time it takes bumps up to 2+ weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
