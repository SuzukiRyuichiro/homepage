      <description>Film development in Japan is getting worse and more expensive I&amp;rsquo;ve been developing film with mostly Kitamura, one of the biggest photo printing chain in Japan. Many stores in Tokyo have in-store developer and scanner and they would develop, scan and give you a QR code from which you can download the results. I used to like the quality and how easy it is to use. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that recently, they increased the price for a higher quality scan, and they made the cheaper scanning option&amp;rsquo;s quality so low.</description>
